Russell and I are having the same [problem with our
wallets](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2010/04/the-long-wallet.html).

Mine’s a Barclaycard
[PayPass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard%23PayPass) that’s giving me
a headache, though. Might get one of those small tube maps that are made out
of metal to fix the problem. He’s right that this is going to become more
common though, especially as banks start rolling out more cards like this.
