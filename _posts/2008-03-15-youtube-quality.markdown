There's been a lot of talk around on the quality of YouTube's video, and how
it's going to be improving dramatically over the next few weeks or months. I'm
continually disappointed by the slow rollout of website features, because I
always seem to get them last (think back to how long it took me to get IMAP
working on Gmail).

But apparently YouTube love me at least a little bit, because they've
re-encoded one of my videos using the higher quality FLV settings that they're
slowly getting out there. I was skeptical about what the difference would
actually be, but it turns out to be fairly significant. Screenshots are below
for your comparing pleasure, and I did choose a bit with text as it highlights
the change even better than just video can.

You can give it a go with both the [lower

quality](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZBn5pZRK2o&fmt=18) videos.
