Quirky lecturer thing: Maths person who pauses, says the word "right?" fairly
distinctively and then continues. Lectures take five times longer because of
this (technically, we get five times less stuff done because of this). I got
so frustrated with it last week that I decided to put an asterisk in the
margin of my notes every time he did his thing...

Conclusion: 47 times. 47 times he did this. I wanted to cry a little.
