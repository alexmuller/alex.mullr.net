I wrote a bit for the office blog about our work writing HTML and CSS that ends
up printed on a bit of paper a couple of inches wide:

> For web developers, there’s no real technical challenge in the front-end
> side of creating a publication; it’s all HTML and CSS with nothing to think
> about other than how WebKit will render your page in black and white. But
> this lack of difficulty is more than made up for with the tough constraints
> imposed by the media and the size it’ll be printed at. The printable area is
> less than 400 pixels wide and just 800 tall to avoid the unpleasant surprise
> of waking up to a publication five metres long trailing across the floor.
> Berg’s guidelines recommend that text should be sized no smaller than 20px
> (and they’re dead on), but with letters so large and paper so small there
> isn’t room to say much.

I love the way that our blog looks and works. It's an Octopress-based static
site. [Bel][bel] created designs that look awesome, and [David][jalada] and I
set the thing up.
