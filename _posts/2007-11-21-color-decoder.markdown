[blogs](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/what-colour-is-that) about a new
$22 OS X application, [Color Decoder](http://straycattech.com/). Put simply,
it converts on-screen colour (RGB, CMYK values) into easy to understand colour
names.

> It watches the color underneath the mouse pointer, displays the
> color's name near the mouse pointer, optionally speaks its name using
> speech synthesis, and flashes areas where the same color appears on
> the screen.

Worth downloading the trial version and having a play with it if you can, but
I'm afraid not worth the asking price for me. Interesting just to think about
**how** it works - purplish white, vivid reddish orange?
