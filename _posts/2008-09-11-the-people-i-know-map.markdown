I'm not doing much to counter the theory that there is too much free time in
the world. Spent half an hour this evening going through my address book to
create a Google Map of people I know, so without saying any more:

[![People I Know](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-11-googlemapspeople.png)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-11-googlemapspeople.png)

To be honest I am a little disappointed in how concentrated the pointers are
around the UK. To clarify this map, it's populated by people who I know well
enough to know where their permanent address is. Not that I'm inviting myself
to stay or anything...

How data changes over time is starting to really interest me - things like,
for example, how listening habits can be graphed year by year to see changes,
or the fantastic [TweetStats](http://tweetstats.com/), which gives a whole
bunch of numbers and pretty bar charts. I would be very interested in
recreating this map in four years time, or maybe even ten years time, and
seeing what has changed.

Hope I haven't forgotten anyone this time round.
