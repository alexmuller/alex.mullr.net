Email is really important to me, especially at the moment - I'm going to be
moving a fair bit over the next few months, but my email can stay in one place
(the cloud, if you don't cringe every time you hear that). Like just about
every geek, I'm in love with what Google have achieved with Gmail. The
simplicity, while at the same time managing to offer every feature I could
need along with bucket loads of storage (all for free) is amazing.

This one is a screenshot of the webmail system implemented at York University at the moment:

Wow. While I'm sure there were reasons for using this software, I'd be curious
to know what advantages it offers over MS Exchange Server or Google Apps.
Let's be honest, it's not as pretty as either of them.

* What happens when I click on the sender? Does it start a new email addressed to them, or open the one in the inbox?
* Why does the subject truncate, leaving a whole load of blue space?
* Why isn't the time received displayed?
* Where's the calendaring functionality offered by both Google and Microsoft?
* Why do I only get 30MB of storage compared to Gmail's 7 gigabytes?

One thing that really concerns me is whether I'll be able to hang onto my
email for years to come. I'm a complete
[hoarder](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/07/memories/), so I have this
irrational urge to want to keep every message received... which is why Gmail
appeals so much.

For the last four years, I've had all my email from my school redirected to my
'personal' Gmail account. Having left school, I'm over the moon that I still
have 524 emails about crap like my A Level choices. You won't understand this
unless you're stupidly crazy-obsessive like me, but just to have the ability
to be able to read any of that is great. I haven't even started at York yet
and I've already set up redirection using their online IT account system; I
don't want to leave the university and lose four years worth of correspondence
with professors and friends.

What's the absolute worst case scenario right now? That Google goes bump, or
decides it can't be arsed to keep Gmail ticking along anymore, but something
tells me [that won't
happen](http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chdet=1220918920878&chddm=398429&q=NASDAQ:GOOG&ntsp=0)
just yet. This is an issue that's going to become **even** more important than
it is right now: the ability for users to extract their data from a service
and move somewhere else. Someone clever already took the idea and [gave it a
name](http://www.dataportability.org/).
