Just got back from Regent Street – had a play with the new iPod Classic and
Nano, and the interface on both of them (as well as slight size reductions)
makes them absolutely lovely…

Saw the following poster on the tube – as far as I can gather, it's a
Barclaycard with integrated Oyster Card – at the moment, I'm imagining it
automatically taking money out of your bank account to pay for the bus and
underground, which would be nice and easy. I wish I could sign up, but
apparently 18 is the age to be before Barclays gives you the ability to spend
money that you don't possess. It reads:

> It's the three cards a londoner needs /

To the person outside Oxford Circus station: thanks for your advice, but I
didn't have the heart to tell you that I don't want your damn leaflet and I
don't care to hear about your religious views – please don't follow me half
way down the street if it's obvious I don't want to talk to you:

> "Don't be a sinner, be a winner"

And finally to the fantastic people at London Underground – honestly, it was great:

> Victoria line driver: **"A quick message to man near the back of train with
> the pushchair – please don't block the doors, it's especially dangerous with
> young children"** (or words to that effect) – not that people should need to
> be told this, but I thought it was good for the driver to call him out on it.

District line driver: London Underground must have some bizarre new policy of
actually telling their customers what the hell is going on, because this guy
was really good – **"Ladies and gentlemen, I've just been informed by District
line control that the Piccadilly line service that was suspended because of a
security alert at Knightsbridge is now through-running"** – perhaps I've just
never had somebody as considerate as him driving a damn train before, I don't
know

One last thing: who knew that if you lean on the doors of a new District line
train, it applies the brakes automatically – at least, so says the
aforementioned driver.

It's the little things that make the difference for me…

[Currently playing music](http://www.last.fm/music/Sugarcult/_/You%27re+the+One) very appropriate: "I'm in love, but it's only temporary" – to those who get it, and that number is probably limited to 1

My apologies for the disjointed ramblings of this post
