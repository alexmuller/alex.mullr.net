I took the photo below as a bit of a joke (hey, Vaio stickers are a joke...
right?) but it's interesting to have a record of the "old" Google Reader which
was on my screen at the time. When it recently changed, I remember quite a few
people complaining at how the layout seemed less intuitive; now, of course,
I'd easily vote for the new, cleaner look.

Sometimes, I guess you just have to get through a few days or weeks of your
users complaining at change - especially in this fairly new space of
constantly evolving online software. And other times, the change isn't so
great and your users might actually have valid concerns (hey, Facebook, look
over here).
