I’ve installed these great [Dropbox Snow Leopard
Services](http://wiki.getdropbox.com/DropboxAddons/Dropbox%2520Service) on my
10.6 MacBook. If you haven’t seen what the services improvements in Snow
Leopard can do for you, check out some [videos from the
PixelCorps](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak235).

> My single favorite improvement in Snow Leopard is the overhaul to system-wide Services.
