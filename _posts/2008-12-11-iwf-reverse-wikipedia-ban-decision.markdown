By way of an update to [my earlier
post](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/12/the-iwf/), The Guardian [reported
late on Tuesday](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/09/wikipedia-iwf-ban-lifted)
that the Internet Watch Foundation has decided to reverse "its ban on a
Wikipedia page and image of a record album cover showing a young nude girl".

This apparently "unprecedented move" (of what, jackasses changing their mind
when they're clearly wrong?) is a brilliant thing. As though it couldn't get
better, they even admitted that it actually had the opposite effect to what
they'd intended. In other words, many more people have seen the album cover
now.

This whole situation is hilarious. They've now admitted that they can, at
times, be wrong, which is going to make life a hell of a lot more difficult
for them in the future. Enjoy, IWF. Here's a link to [their press
release](http://www.iwf.org.uk/media/news.251.htm).
