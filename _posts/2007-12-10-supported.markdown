I believe that if a company seriously impresses me in a certain area, it's
worth giving them as much praise as I can about it - in that hope that it
might just cause other companies to improve. To that end, this blog went down
for a couple of hours last night because of a MySQL issue with the shared
server it's running onâ€¦ and, here comes the plug: I sent
[**Bluehost**](http://www.bluehost.com/) a support ticket, which they replied
to within half a day.

The response I got was fast, polite, friendly and personal - a lot more than
it needed to be, at least. Perhaps it's a sad realisation of just how rubbish
companies can be to their customers these days, but the fact that Bluehost
were so great gave me a nice feeling inside. And I don't care how that sounds.

Recommended, without a doubt.
