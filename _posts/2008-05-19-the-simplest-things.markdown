I guess it's true that even the simplest things take the longest time:

[![New logo](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wikipedia-logo-new.png)](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wikipedia-logo-new.png)

You may not be able to see it on the above screen captures (right click, view
image might make it better) but replacing the logo with a new version to
remove some ugly white pixels took four days after the new version had been
created. That's the work of one developer changing one image on server - I can
appreciate that server admins have a lot to do, but **wow** that was a long
wait. Anyway, end rant.
