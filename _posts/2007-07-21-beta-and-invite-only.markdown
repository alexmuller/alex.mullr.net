I've had the chance to play with Plasq's new beta-invite-only software Skitch
for about a month now, and it's really great.

At the same time however, it highlights (for me at least) a problem with beta
software in general. I've been sitting, making [silly little pictures](http://myskitch.com/alexmuller/legendary-20070616-210420.jpg),
happily using this software. The thing I've failed to take into account is
that so far, it's been completely free.

I wonder what happens when I have to pay £15 for the software – chances are,
I'll stop using it… and this goes for everything, including (but not limited
to) Gmail, Flickr and Lastfm. As a side note, I actually do pay a tiny amount
for some extra features on Lastfm and probably would pay for Gmail if they
implemented the same system. So beta software is all well and good, but
remember that it won't stay beta forever (or maybe it will, who knows these
days).

And as for invite-only sites and software: keep doing it, but make sure I get
an invite – it makes me feel all special inside…
