I've been messing about a bit with the time lapse movie feature that's built into the Canon PowerShot G9 (a gorgeous camera, by the way, and I can't wait to see what they do with the G10). Here are my efforts so far:

The London bus journey time lapse was inspired by [Homeward Timelapse Part 1

Offspring are copyright Columbia Records (as far as I can tell) and used in
these videos under fair use.
