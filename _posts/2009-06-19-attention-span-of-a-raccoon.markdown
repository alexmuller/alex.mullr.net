Rumour (well, the [YSTV](http://ystv.york.ac.uk/) quotes board) has it that I
once said, when asking for confirmation on something television-related: "I
have the attention span of a raccoon!" I think I've started to have problems
with the tiny length of time I can keep focused on a task…

Something that I've been noticing increasingly lately is that the more "stuff"
that gets thrown at me, the more I've reduced the amount to which it can
bother me. When I started out with a Mac Mini and 4:3 display a couple of
years ago, I had [Google
Notifier](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html) set up to
make an obscene noise, show me my unread email count and display an overlay
with the new message summary. I had system wide notifications set up for IMs,
tweets, iTunes changing. In short, my computer was **really** annoying.

Since then, I've switched off pretty much everything. Tweets appear in the
background, and I'll read them if I want. New instant message conversations
show a tiny exclamation mark in the menu bar. Google Notifier… well, I
actually just quit Google Notifier. I want to see how long I can do without
it, but hope this is the start of something productive. Honestly, didn't
realise how much all that stuff pained me until I got rid of it, and I don't
think I'll be going back.

So consider this a poke for you to do something about your pain-in-the-arse
computer; the revelation that the world won't implode if I don't reply to
email just hit me, and it feels good.
