A quick post on how ridiculous my daily sleeping schedule has become:

* Wake up at 6:30 to get to school
* Get home in the afternoon and sleep from about 6 until 11
* Spend from eleven in the evening until about 2 or 3am doing all the stuff I
  should've been doing the rest of the time
* Sleep from 3 through till 6:30

The best part - I'm still getting about eight hours sleep a night (well, _a
day_) so **technically** I shouldn't be tired. **Practically**, I'm absolutely
shattered.

The news story I never want to hear again:
[Children face 'intense pressure'](http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jrrdpDYnXVPUu-v0ar1LQs6ma8yg).
Let me be very clear that my being tired is not at all the fault of pressure
from school, and help the first person who says it is. For now, let's just
blame the web and leave it at that.

The most ridiculous part - this is habit now, and if I want to break it,
effort will be required. Guess I'm lucky that there's no school for the next
two weeks, so I can sleep whenever I like. That'll have to fit in around me
redesigning the blog to make it look less _Wordpress-y_.
