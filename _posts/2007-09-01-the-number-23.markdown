I wasn't intending this to turn into The Movie Blog, but I've seen a few films
recently, so here goes:

It's weird what this film's done to me - the background very briefly, for
those who don't know, is that Jim Carrey is turned insane by the number 23.
After seeing the film this evening, I've started seeing the number everywhere
- you don't have to believe this, but I can promise you it's no joke: my
friend's CD player was paused on track twenty-three, there were 23 cars parked
on the side of the street we walked down, and you'll never guess what table we
sat at to eatâ€¦ by the way, [GBK](http://www.gbkinfo.com/index.php) is
delicious.

Spooky, but the film sums it up nicely: once you start looking for something,
you see it everywhere
