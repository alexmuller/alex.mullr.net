Transport for London send weekly emails about which London Underground lines
and stations are going to be closed to maintenance and improvement work on the
weekend. This is from the one titled “Weekend line and station closures 5/6
September 2009”:

> Piccadilly line trains will not stop at King's Cross St. Pancras station due
> to station improvement work on Saturday. For further details and alternative
> routes, please click here

Which is why I was really pleased to be standing at that very station at 6pm
yesterday (**Sunday** the 6th) with no Piccadilly line trains stopping there.
If you’re going to go as far as sending out an email to warn people, how about
checking it’s actually right?
