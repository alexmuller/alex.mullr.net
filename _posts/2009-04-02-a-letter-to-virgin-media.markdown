I've had a few issues with my Virgin Media cable connection over the last few
days, and wanted to write about it here. We're in a pretty difficult position
at home: as Virgin have a monopoly on the UK cable market, and we can't have
ADSL over our phone line, we **have** to stick with them no matter what. I'd
never tell them that to their face, of course...

So, our connection died at about 4pm on Monday afternoon. I called up their
support number at 9pm and got put through to India. I was asked to reboot the
modem, and when it didn't work again I was told we could wait for it to be
sorted, or book an engineer.

I decided to sleep on it, and called them back on Tuesday daytime (again,
Indian call centre). Again, I had to reboot the modem, and was told to
disconnect my Apple router because they couldn't support that. She didn't sort
the problem - when I tried to get her to report an issue (open a ticket, have
an engineer look at it on their end), all she'd say was the stock line: "I've
checked the system, there are no issues in your area."

I was out all day Wednesday, but called them back that night. I was put
through to John in Swansea; whatever Virgin are paying John, it isn't enough;
VM should be proud to be employing somebody so competent. He did some tests
straight away on my modem, saw some strange power fluctuations, and said
immediately that it needed an engineer to look at it. He booked one for
Monday, commented on how their internal support systems are so slow, and let
me off the phone.

At 1pm today (Thursday), I got a text saying they'd fix the problem within
eight hours and that they'd cancelled my engineer. At 4pm, I received a
voicemail saying the problem was sorted. I don't know whether John was correct
that my modem needs looking at, but if so... it can happen some other time.
The connection's working fine now, and I'm happy.

Here's the interesting thing (to me): I was really pissed off on Tuesday
afternoon. Truthfully, I was incredibly pissed off until I spoke to a UK call
centre. Quality of phone support is so important, and I hope Virgin aren't
moving more of their operations out of the UK. That's the kind of thing that,
in the long run, would lose us as customers. And finally, to the people behind
[@virginmedia on Twitter](http://twitter.com/virginmedia): what you're doing
(openness & pretty immediate availability) is really cool... please keep it
up.
