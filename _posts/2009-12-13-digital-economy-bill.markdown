I just don’t get the Digital Economy Bill. I don’t understand how it’s got to
this point.

Cory wrote [that article](http://boingboing.net/2009/11/20/britains-new-interne.html) which
we’ve all read by now.

Tim [linked to](http://twitter.com/timd/status/6628505660) [Francis Davey’s take on part of
it](http://www.francisdavey.co.uk/2009/12/government-wants-new-powers-to-block.html).

And then I started clicking, and reading, and clicking more. And I took a look
on [TheyWorkForYou.com](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/) to see if anybody
cares about it. And I found out that Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer
cares. And she asked [one of the best
questions](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91210w0001.htm#09121056000287)
I’ve ever read:

> To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have sought the advice of Sir
> Tim Berners-Lee, the adviser to the Minister for the Cabinet Office on public
> information delivery, on clauses 4 to 20 of the Digital Economy Bill and on
> any impact on access to the internet; and, if so, what was his advice. [HL441]

To which Lord Young of Norwood Green, _The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of
State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills_, replied:

> While we are always interested in the views of acknowledged experts, we have
> not directly sought the advice of Sir Tim Berners-Lee in relation to Clauses 4
> to 20 of the Digital Economy Bill.

Her Majesty’s Government did not consult the **inventor of the World Wide
Web** - who already works with the Office of the Prime Minister - on the
**Digital Economy** Bill. Can you tell where the stupid is yet?
