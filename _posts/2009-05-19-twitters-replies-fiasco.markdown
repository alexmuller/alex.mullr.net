You know what the stupidest part of [this whole
ridiculousness](http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/replies-kerfuffle.html) is?
Twitter did it (ok, for technical reasons apparently - but we didn't find that
out until later) so that we wouldn't see fragments of conversation. It's right
there in [the original
post](http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/small-settings-update.html):

> However, receiving one-sided fragments via replies sent to folks you don't
follow in your timeline is undesirable.

Except they haven't even prevented that. If my friend replies to somebody I
don't follow, I now don't see it - when I would have previously. If one of my
friends then replies to this reply that I haven't seen, I end up getting a
fragment (only seeing half of the messages). Stupid.
