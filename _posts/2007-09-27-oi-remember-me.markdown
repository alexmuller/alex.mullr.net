![Facebook - Remember Me](http://mullr.net/images/wordpress/2007/facebook-rememberme.png)

This week, the most monumentally fantastic thing happened in my life –
Facebook finally added a bloody **Remember Me** button. At last, no more
hitting the return key to login every time I close the browser – this is
definitely going to increase the life of my keyboard dramatically…

Joking aside, why did it take so damn long? And I hate the patronising warning
it gives when you check the box – guess they thought it was necessary though.
