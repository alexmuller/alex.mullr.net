I spent an hour this evening sitting on a stationary District line train in
West London, so I've had a little time to think over what's wrong with the
transport system in London – and I think I'm getting towards understanding
something (in my head, at least). The problem with [Transport for
London](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/) is that as they've grown since 2000, they've
forgotten the things that make smaller companies nice. And actually, this
isn't at all specific to TfL - the same could be said for any large company.

The example from today was that there were three District line trains stood
still in three consecutive stations. A small company (the Last.fm, Pownce and
Twitters of the world) would have decided that the Piccadilly line trains
should make an unscheduled stop on the platform next to us so that we could
move across and continue our journey at some kind of speed. The large company
(Microsoft, Apple, IBM or in this case, TfL) had so much going on that it was
impossible to organise and execute – our tube driver admitted that he had
asked for another train to stop, but that the District line controller and
Piccadilly line controller would have to "discuss" first, by which time it was
far too late for us.

The ideal turn of events for this evening would have been for a Piccadilly
train driver to notice the massive congestion and just stop his train so that
we could all hop on – but of course that's never actually going to happen. I
know that example was convoluted, obscure and totally random, but that's what
most of my thoughts are like.

Actually, be careful what you wish for – the day Twitter goes anywhere near
running our tube network will be an [interesting](http://status.twitter.com/)
