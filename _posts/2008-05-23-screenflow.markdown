I've started playing with an app called
[Screenflow](http://www.varasoftware.com/products/screenflow/). As always, I'm
totally late to the reviewing-brand-new-Mac-software game, but I'll throw a
couple of compliments in their direction anyway.

Wow, this thing is incredible. Really amazing. On first launch, having read
absolutely no documentation, I recorded a minute and a half of me on the new
Last.fm beta, which you can find [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUG9cGw1rBY&fmt=18).
It's simple and flexible, exactly what my impression of a Mac app is. Easy
things, like changing the size of the pointer to make it easier to see, or
having a "radar" bubble appear every time you click, make it so much nicer.
Export to movie, upload to YouTube - just as easy as creating content should
be.

Go, play...
