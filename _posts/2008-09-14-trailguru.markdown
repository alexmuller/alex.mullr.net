No matter how much [negative press](http://daringfireball.net/2008/09/app_store_exclusion)
the App Store is getting at the moment, I'm continually surprised by the availability (and
quality) of the software you can get without spending anything at all.
[Trailguru](http://www.trailguru.com/) is a MediaWiki (think software that
runs Wikipedia) based site for tracking your running, hiking and snowboarding
using GPS.

Sign up for an account on the site, install the application onto the latest
generation iPhone (it does work with other devices) and hit "Start". Location
services in the phone grab your position every couple of seconds and record it
along with the time you were there. When you're done, the phone can post the
trip directly to the Trailguru site, giving you [a map like
this](http://www.trailguru.com/wiki/index.php/Track:QH6). Everything on that
page is automatically generated, including the very specific location
information in the title.

Of course, it wouldn't appeal nearly as much to me if there weren't some nice
stats features built in... something a little like [my reports
page](http://www.trailguru.com/ui/user/reports/Alexmuller). There's an
argument for not wanting to make this stuff so public, but it doesn't bother
me - getting all this for free means that sharing the data is worth it, in my
opinion.
