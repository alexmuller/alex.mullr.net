I’ve been in South Africa for two weeks, and am here for one more. There are
so many fascinating things about this place, but for a geek the obvious place
to start is comparing the technology here with back home.

First: everything’s mobile here. ADSL is a fairly new thing ([MWEB have just
announced their first uncapped
package](http://mybroadband.co.za/news/adsl/11829.html)) and fibre is in the
process of being laid ([come on BT, they’re catching
up](http://www.broadband.bt.com/fibre/?s_cid=con_FURL_fibre)), so using a 3G
data modem to connect to the Internet is pretty popular. This makes it a great
place for somebody arriving with an unlocked iPhone; we popped down to a
Vodacom (South African Vodafone) store and bought a prepaid SIM card for R3
(27p) and 1GB of data for R289 (about £26).

Looking at costs for their mobile data, they charge anywhere from R2 (18p)
down to 19c (1.7p) per megabyte, depending on your bundle size. Their top
option is a massive 20GB for R3899 (£350), so you can get a sense of how
heavily people must rely on it. With my gigabyte of data, I was paying 28c/MB
(or **2.5p/MB**). Compare that to O2, who wanted to charge me **£6 per
megabyte**, and I’m left wondering why anybody would ever pay roaming data
charges again. I enjoyed the “awww, see you soon” SMS that O2 sent me:

> Please be aware it’s expensive using data on your iPhone abroad. […]

Oh nope. Using the data isn’t the expensive part, is it O2?

If I’d left my O2 SIM in my phone, with exactly the same usage, I would’ve
been left with a bill for £6,144. Not the £26 I actually paid. 236× the cost.
I want to stop writing the same thing over and over again, but just can’t get
my head around it.

### The curse of the APN

I’ve always hated dealing with phone network settings, mostly because it’s
never worked. After some searching, I found that you need to change the
Cellular Data APN on the iPhone to `internet`. After a quick call--and 24 hour
wait--to the people who deal with Vodacom data on 082155 (asking them to
enable the iPhone APN and tethering), you can change the Cellular Data APN
back to `iphone.vodacom.za` (and as a bonus, you’ll then be able to tether).

### Sorry

I didn’t mean this to turn into a rant about the extortion racket that is my
mobile phone provider, but that seems to be the way it turned out. I’d like to
thank Vodacom for being so great, and wish O2 a slow, painful death.
Hopefully, I’ll post more about being here some time soon.
