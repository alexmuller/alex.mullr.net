Spending a week with people who aren't completely insane over technology has
been refreshing. They don't mind giving me their laptop to use, whereas I'm
crazy to the point that I can hardly leave people alone with my lovely shiny
new machine.

The family computer here is a Dell Inspiron which is at least four or five
years old, reinforcing (to me at least) something that Leo Laporte mentions on
his US radio show, [The Tech Guy](http://techguylabs.com/), relatively often:
you don't **need** a new machine, you want a new machine because the old one
looks clunky. This Inspiron still runs XP (albeit slowly) and Office, and can
surf the web fine. To be honest, I'm surprised that some part of it hasn't
given out yet, but I suppose it's only a matter of time.

And I have to look on the bright side – it means my MacBook looks even
prettier than normal.
