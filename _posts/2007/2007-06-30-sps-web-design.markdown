As school's finished and i've got nothing better to do at the moment, i thought i'd take on the 'fun' task of a new design for our school intranet. To start, here's a look at what we see at the moment:

Without being cruel, it's obvious that design wasn't high up on the list of things to do. [Firefly](http://www.fireflysolutions.co.uk/page.aspx) (our CMS) is functional, but its sheer greyness makes me want to bang my head against a wall. And don't get me started on the fact that some of the teachers who are responsible for updating these pages don't quite grasp web design ([example](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/economics-screencap.png)).

So i've made a start on my own design. I don't claim to be more qualified than anybody when it comes to this, it's just a hobby. And i haven't taken coding into this at all yet - no doubt it would be impossible, but i've had fun doing it.

**A few notes:**

* The blue gradient would ideally drop behind the main (staff-editable) page a little more
* The page editor can, in theory, create as many links and sub-links as they like - obviously it's not possible to keep on creating rows at the top of the page for each set of links, to eventually take up the whole screen
* The smallest resolution monitor we have at school is 1024x768, so i guess it has to work at that resolution
* Visual cues (the top bar, with sub-links underneath) borrowed from digg.com
