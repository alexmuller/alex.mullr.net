![Junk Mail](http://mullr.net/images/wordpress/2007/junk_mail.jpg)

Today was a fantastic day - I got my first piece of actual junk mail in the
post, which meant I could do something I first [read
about](http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=junk_the_junk) from
Maddox (while I'm talking about him, just finished his book - [The Alphabet of
Manliness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alphabet_of_Manliness) - and it's
the funniest thing I've read in a long time).

The idea is simple: you take a prepaid envelope that a company sends you, fill
it full of other rubbish (Maddox uses coupons) and post it back to them. The
end result is that they pay for the postage going back to them, eventually
dissuading them from sending this stuff out. I know I have too much time at
the moment, but I'm going to keep doing this in the hope that one day they
might stop.

To name names, as I'm feeling a little bitter - Haymarket Media Group sold my
address from a magazine subscription, and I received advertising from Bose and
Hiscox home insurance.
