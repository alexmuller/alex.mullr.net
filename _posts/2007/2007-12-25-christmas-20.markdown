Happy Christmas to everyone out there - honestly, I've never had a 25th
December where the web is used so much, with greetings over Facebook and
instant messaging springing to mindâ€¦ anyway, before I get back to the absolute
awesomeness of the entire family crammed into a room that really isn't big
enough to hold them, the Christmas Wikipedia article actually made me burst
out laughing this morning:
