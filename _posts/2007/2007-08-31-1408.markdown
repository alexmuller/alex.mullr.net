Just got back from seeing the new horror film
[1408](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/) - it was fine (quite immersive,
but nothing amazing). It did make me jump, but that's nothing special -
everything slightly scary makes me jump.

I even smiled in a couple of places, the first being when Mike Enslin's Dell
(product placement anybody?) laptop showed a blue screen of death after
getting a little damp from the fire sprinklers. But it's all OK, because the
computer decided to switch itself back later on in the film so that he could
have a video chat with his wife. The second smile moment was just weird: some
of his daughter's clothes came out the hotel fax machine…
