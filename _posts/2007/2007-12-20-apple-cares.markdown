I'm sure friends of mine will be absolutely shocked to hear this, but I've
fallen in love with Apple all over again. After taking my flickering MacBook
to the Regent Street [Genius Bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_Bar) for
the third time, they caved and completely replaced it for me. The only catch
(so far as I can tell now) was that I had to get the tube to Brent Cross, but
apart from that they were absolutely fantastic.

So I now have a MacBook that's 0.2 GHz faster, has a 40 GB larger hard drive,
and an [X3100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_GMA#GMA_X3100) instead of a
GMA950. Oh, and the screen doesn't flicker anymore :-)

By the way, to all the people on the northern most (Edgware branch) of the
Northern Line, **please** try and smile just a little bit moreâ€¦ you all look
so crazily depressed.
