Today [somebody](http://michaelstech.wordpress.com) asked me why I don't set
updates to twitter.com so that only my friends can read them, and I just
thought up a satisfactory answer – which a few people I know won't agree with.
**Online privacy is nonexistent for me.** It always has been, and it's not a
big deal. The fact is that as soon as that message is made semi-public,
anybody can actually see it. It doesn't take much for a friend to show his
phone to somebody else, or forward on an email.

The great story I'm reminded of is a Microsoft employee who sent an unpleasant
message to a colleague, protected by some feature in MS Office to prevent
copying and pasting. The receiver took out his mobile phone, took a picture of
the message on the screen and sent it back via MMS. Unfortunately I can't find
a link to back it up, but I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

As a fantastic side-note, it's half past four in the morning and I'm in an
unfamiliar house, pretty much on my own. My two friends are "occupied", so I
plan on enjoying the morning (after blogging of course, which was the obvious
first choice). Hope everyone else got more sleep than I did.
