Just got home, so I thought I'd fill y'all in on what I did with my Wednesday:

* Left here (Chiswick, London) at about **7:50** this morning, getting to
  Warwick (the town, not the university) at about **9:45**.
* Spent an hour and a half (yup, till **11:15**) sitting in the biggest
  traffic jam ever with all the people going to the open day. The real kicker:
  that traffic, from just outside Coventry to the university, couldn't have
  been more than two or three miles long.
* Two hours looking round the campus, decided it was just like every other
  campus university I'd been to see so far. Queues for decent-looking food too
  long, so took the decision to go home.
* Drove from **1:20** till **3:20**, normal university open day lunch
  (sandwich, crisps, Coke from a service station) eaten in the car.

So if we add that all up, it comes out to **six** hours driving and **two**
hours at the actual university. Not that I didn't like the uni - I really did,
but I'm starting to think that London's the place I want to stay. And by the
way, on the way home, the two miles that took an hour and a half before took
just **seven** minutes. I've done nothing all day, but I'm still shattered.
Might start swimming again, just so I'm not doing nothing.
