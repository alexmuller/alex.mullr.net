This is interesting advice from Facebook that I'd never seen before - not a
bad way of putting it, either:

> Remember, unless you're prepared to attach something in your profile to a
> resume or scholarship application, don't post it.

Unfortunate that it's hidden in
[help.php](http://facebook.com/help.php?tab=safety), the only link to which is
right at the bottom of the page.
