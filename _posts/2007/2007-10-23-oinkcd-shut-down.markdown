More to come on this, but
[TorrentFreak](http://torrentfreak.com/oinkcd-servers-raided-admin-arrested/)
and the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/7057812.stm) both have
articles up already. Developing since about 8am UK time today.

> A 24-year-old man from Middlesbrough was arrested on Tuesday morning.

The IT worker was led from his home in the town's Grange Road and is being
questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and infringement of copyright
law.

**Suspicion** of **conspiracy** to defraud? Really??

Interesting that every article so far has said that the servers were
confiscated by Dutch police a week ago – erm, the site was working fine after
that…

I need to form an opinion, I guess – to quote somebody on a forum, who sums me
up pretty perfectly

> i've never felt such a horrible feeling over something on the internet.

To expand on what's happened since the 23rd October (it's now Sunday the 28th):

Most of the active members have reconvened at another online forum, set up
specifically for discussing the current situation. People are creating and
uploading [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av5HDyLL_VY) to YouTube. In
short, this community isn't going anywhere anytime soon. And based on the fact
that the original OiNK index page is now showing a message about waffles (what
**The Pirate Bay** did the last time they brought back a bittorrent tracker),
it might even be coming back.
