Taken from Transport for London's online "Journey history" feature, which
allows you to see where you've been on your Oyster card, at what time, and how
much it cost (by the way, it's a fantastic feature - except for this).

> For legal reasons we are only able to display up to eight weeks of data.

Allow me to translate: for legal reasons, we can only show you where you've
been for the past eight weeks. Jeez, just imagine what would happen if **I**
could see where **I** travelled to nine weeks ago…
