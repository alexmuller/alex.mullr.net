I like the stats, soâ€¦

> 2065 - number of emails in **Gmail** since October 26th, 2004
> 
> 3067 - number of **digg.com** stories and videos I've dugg
> 
> 6987 - number of RSS entries read in **Google Reader** over the last 30 days
> 
> 8095 - number of songs scrobbled to **last.fm** since May 17th, 2006

Interested to see the statistics that last.fm are going to generate with their
new [audio fingerprinting](http://blog.last.fm/2007/08/29/audio-fingerprinting-for-clean-metadata)
application
