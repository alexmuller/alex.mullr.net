I watched a 20 minute documentary this afternoon on BBC News 24 about the One
Laptop per Child program in Africa.

Really interesting seeing the parents saying just how pleased they were that
their children didn't go out to play nearly as much as they did before the
arrival of the laptops, and were busy working. In developed countries, I'd say
the opinion's pretty different.

Something that really hit me from the program is that teachers in Nigeria seem
to be more willing, accepting of and excited about technology in the classroom
than anywhere I've seen in the UK. Whether that's down to the way the BBC
edited the show is up for discussion, but I still noticed it. In any case, it
made me feel bad seeing how animated the teaching staff were when using the
new laptops in a lesson, and no doubt there are teachers here who could do
with watching that segment.

It also highlighted the [CMPC](http://www.classmatepc.com/), a rival project
"powered by Intel", which I'd never heard of before.

Quote to sum it up from reporter Rory Cellan Jones:

> If I came in tomorrow and said we're going to take your laptops away
> and you'll never be able to use them again, what would you be, happy
> or sad?

Every kid in the (crowded) room yells **"sad!"**

You can watch it on the BBC's iPlayer for the next 5 days (until about the
17th Jan) [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/b008qstj.shtml).
