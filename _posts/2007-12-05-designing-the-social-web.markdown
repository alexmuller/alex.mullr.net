Just a quick note to say many thanks to Jeremy Keith, who came to St Paul's
last Tuesday (the 4th) to talk about **Designing the Social Web**. It was
fantastically well received by all, and I wish I'd had the chance to stay and
chat over lunch afterwardsâ€¦

Jeremy's [written](http://adactio.com/journal/1388) something about the day on
his blog, for those interested.
