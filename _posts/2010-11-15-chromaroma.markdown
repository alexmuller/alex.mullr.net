[Chromaroma](http://chromaroma.com/) is a London-based game involving Oyster
cards; you link your card up to your account and it pulls data in from TfL’s
journey history.

I wanted to be able to see more of the data that Chromaroma has stored up, so
I took the stations off the leaderboard (the most visited stations) and
plotted them onto TfL’s tube map. The more swipes a station’s had, the larger
it appears. Oh, and coloured according to which team currently owns it.

### The result?

Yep, it’s just blobs and a river. But hey, they’re pretty blobs. I’d love to
see some kind of simple visualisation like this on the site.
