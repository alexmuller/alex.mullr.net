Lewis Bretts was elected to the Student Union at the University of York last
summer, beating Ed Durkin, Dave Sharp and George Papadofragakis. Recently, the
student newspaper has been [having issues with his
promises](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2010/01/26/bretts-knew-fruit-and-veg-couldn%E2%80%99t-happen/).
At first glance, this seems like student politics and student journalism
mixing and turning a little crazy, as normal. Except, then I had a look at his
manifesto.

<table style="background-color: white;">
<tbody><tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>A weekly fresh fruit a veg market stall on campus</td><td><a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2010/01/26/bretts-knew-fruit-and-veg-couldn%E2%80%99t-happen/" style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;">Um, no</a></td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Temporary ATMs during Freshers Week</td><td>Too hard to organise, apparently</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Weekly minibus service to Morrisons</td><td>Not that I’ve seen</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Take-away drinks from the Courtyard at the end of the night</td><td>I’m not sure, but I don’t think so</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Temporary re-introduction of the NUS Democracy card</td><td>Again, unsure</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Help college bars compete with the Courtyard</td><td>No evidence for or against this</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Make B Henry’s home of YUSU Comedy</td><td>I haven’t seen anything advertised up there</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Ensure JCRCs are trained by YUSU marketing and design staff</td><td>I don’t think so, but again, no evidence either way</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Support Goodricke during its move</td><td>Sure, he can have this. But it’s a bit of a flimsy one.</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Overhall Ents Rep</td><td>Um?</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Manifesto visible for the entire year</td><td>I got these points <a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/elections/candidates/" style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;" title="2nd February 2010, changing soon">from Nouse</a>. Where’s his?</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Free food in the office day to talk to students</td><td>Not that I’ve seen</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Weekly video blog</td><td>He’s done a few since gaining office, not weekly</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Video footage of UGMs</td><td>I haven’t seen one yet. (Greg points out that YSTV did film one, last term.)</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Provide extra funding for JCRCs to increase election participation</td><td>Not as far as I know, though <a href="http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2010/02/lewis-bretts-amongst-others/#comment-10021">Alex has commented below</a></td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Reduce the debit card fee for YUSU purchases online</td><td>It’s still 50p. Wasn’t it always?</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Public monthly accounts available to students</td><td>Nope</td></tr>
<tr style="color: #f9f9f9; background-color: #a50827;"><td>Make society finances manageable online</td><td>Don’t think so</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f6f6f6;"><td>Make YUSU less reliant on the University for its funding</td><td>Not as far as I know</td></tr>

I’ve generally got a pretty good idea of what’s going on on campus (I read
YUSU’s blog, watch most of Lewis’ video blogs, etc), though I obviously don't
know what's going on inside the Union 24/7. So if I've got something wrong,
like Lewis I’m “human and fallible”, do let me know.

This post shouldn’t just be taken as having a go at Lewis. I read all the
sabbatical officers manifestos after his, and they all offer a fairly similar
theme. Come elections this year (a few weeks to go now), I think I’ll be
looking for the most sensible candidate with the simplest manifesto.

It strikes me as funny that there’s a huge need to get more people involved in
campus at the moment, but we can’t really trust what the only people we have a
choice in actually say. Hmm.
