how fairly new online services are affecting the way we communicate overseas.
He’s right, of course. To me, the most interesting part is his third sentence:

The days of mobile operators being able to charge us way over the odds for
communicating internationally are long gone. My two week holiday in South
Africa is just coming to an end, so this is pretty timely: I’ve used about
400MB of mobile data this trip, which O2 would have liked to charge me
something in the region of £2,400 for. Instead, I [bought a local SIM
card](/blog/2010/04/vodacom-on-iphone-in-south-africa/), put it in my unlocked
iPhone and spent just under £20.

On previous holidays I might’ve sent a dozen text messages to keep up with
friends, which would have cost something like £5. Indeed, my monthly bill
during [a trip to the US a while back](/blog/2009/08/america/) was about
double the usual figure. This holiday, I sent zero text messages. In fact,
barely anybody has my South African phone number.

The difference, though, is that I did send 21 direct messages on Twitter and
nine (slightly longer) messages on Facebook. And seven emails.

And the amount O2 are going to be billing me for roaming this month? £0. I can
only imagine mobile companies are losing--or are going to be losing--a hell of
a lot of revenue from lost international charges.
