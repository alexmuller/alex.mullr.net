[One Click Orgs](http://www.oneclickorgs.com/) is a service to allow
organisations to virtualise the way they’re run, providing a legal structure
to make it easy to do things like open group bank accounts and organise the
decision-making process.

It’s a Ruby on Rails app with the [source available on
GitHub](https://github.com/oneclickorgs/one-click-orgs), and I’ve been working
with the team since last April. [Chris](http://www.feedmechocolate.com/) and
[Martin](http://dekstop.de/) have given me so much help with Rails and Git,
and I’ve learnt so much over the course of the last year.

While everyone else has been focused on making the service actually work, I’ve
been messing around with the way things look; in this case, using Haml and
Sass.

It’s been such a great project to be involved in, especially for an open
source first-timer. Everybody has answered every stupid question I’ve had, and
the [local monthly meetings](http://london.hackspace.org.uk/) have made things
really easy.

This week version 1 was released and it’s giving me great satisfaction to see
something I worked on actually out there. Being used.

Here’s some screenshots of what I helped to sort out, with
[Charles](http://charlesarmstrong.net/), [Colin](http://www.colintate.com/)
and the rest of the team. It begins with version 0.6, which was the latest
version when I started, and continues through to the 1.0 that was released
last night:

I’m very much looking forward to seeing the progress and refinement as we move on.
