[Euan](http://www.euansemple.com/) posted [a photo](http://twitpic.com/4pv4z6)
to Twitter tonight from a tabloid (though I'm not sure which one). The
headline read:

> Beautiful Issy was sucked into drugs by the Internet… it killed her

This of course is [the story of 15-year-old Isobel
Jones-Reilly](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13184470), who (at
the risk of speculating a little) died after taking ecstasy at a friend's
house.

Euan's dead on with his caption:

> Oh FFS

Arthur Martin and Tamara Cohen, writing for The Mail (God, I hate it so), are
reporting that she was "sucked in by the drug-taking exploits of the
celebrities she idolised" and "was hooked on the internet". Take it from
somebody who, according to his mother (!), does have an unhealthy addiction to
"that machine" (as she so affectionately calls it): I may be screwed up in all
sorts of ways, but I've thus far managed to avoid ingesting lethal doses of
various drugs. I'm not particularly sure the two are related.

The way they're trying to spin this makes me so angry:

> Isobel, described as a ‘member of the Myspace Generation’, used at
> least seven social networking sites

As do a huge number of 15-year-olds, I'll bet. How many die each year?

> Jaye Williamson, who was Isobel’s English teacher at Chiswick
> Community College, in west London, said: ‘She was into the kind of
> things that teenagers get into, but she got hooked on the worldwide
> web. She was part of the Myspace generation. She got caught and we are
> devastated.’

I've seen first hand the difference between the words a journalist hears and
what ends up on the page, so I'm hoping that Ms Williamson doesn't stand by
that quote. What on earth does "she got caught" mean?

There's already going to be a backlash of protective parents stopping their
teenage children from leaving the house, at least in the short term. And
thanks to articles like this, it's going to extend to the web as well. Why do
journalists (_shudder_) always feel the need to find something that's
obviously unrelated to blame? I'd love to be a fly on the wall watching
articles like this being produced. The little jokes across the office, the
one-line emails, the instant messages, would all be so revealing.

I don't mean for this post to sound insensitive. While what's happened is
obviously incredibly sad, I wish the papers wouldn't see it as an opportunity
to push the bizarre agenda du jour.
