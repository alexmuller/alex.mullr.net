More detail to come (I hope) but not before a list of the fantastic people we
met yesterday at the ExCel Centre:

* Thomas Vander Wal, [vanderwal.net](http://www.vanderwal.net/) - thanks again
  to Thomas for coming and giving his speech **Going Social** at school last
  Tuesday. We met him again at FOWA and spoke about the use of the term
  **user** online (example: Last.fm's profile address when compared to Flickr)
  as well as Jon Hicks and his [Rissington
  Podcast](http://rafrissington.wordpress.com/).
* Christian Van Der Henst, [Maestros del Web](http://maestrosdelweb.com/) -
  fantastic story: he took [this
  picture](http://flickr.com/photos/cvander/1475730043/) of us and posted it
  to Flickr; we found the picture, commented on it, and then met him at the
  conference.
* Andy Mitchell & George Palmer, [meecard](http://meecard.com) - nice new
  service (registration currently closed - set to open soon) that aggregates
  all your social networks or contact information and puts it in one nice
  digital card.
* Gavin O'Carroll, [Rememble.com](http://rememble.com) - _a 'washing line' for
  your digital bits and pieces_ - the only way to understand it is to go and
  sign up…
* Wouter Broekhof, [Wakoopa](http://wakoopa.com) - these guys are just
  fantastic. Privacy concerns aside, go and sign up for an account and have a
  try. And maybe read through their [Your
  Privacy](http://wakoopa.com/about/privacy) page, especially important as
  they expand to tracking web apps.
* Dave Rooney, [Just Routes](http://justroutes.com/) - nice public transport
  journey planner, though currently only works in Dublin. Would be fantastic
  to see it expanded to London, but understand their reasons for not doing so.
