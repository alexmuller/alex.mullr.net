From the [OpenStreetMap
wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Talk:WikiProject_Haiti%23Fairfax_County_Urban_Search_.26_Rescue_Team_Using_Garmin_downloads),
shared on Google Reader by [Frankie](http://www.frankieroberto.com/). This is
definitely worth a read:

> I am currently in Port Au Prince with the Fairfax County Urban Search
> & Rescue Team (USA-1) out of Fairfax, VA, USA. I wish there was a
> way that I can express to you properly how important your OSM files
> were to us. Most of our team members own their own Garmin Rino and
> 60CSx units on top of the units we already have in the cache. Having
> these detailed maps on our GPS units is a big deal. Shortly after
> discovering your work I quickly spread the word and transferred the
> street level maps onto as many Garmin units as we could before sending
> the American rescue teams on the streets. **The team members are
> thrilled to have this resource you have created. I wish you could see
> their faces 'light up' when I take their GPS unit and tell them that
> I'm going to give them street level detail maps.**

This is just fantastic news.
