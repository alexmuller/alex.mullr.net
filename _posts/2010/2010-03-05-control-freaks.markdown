From a BBC News article today, “[Schoolgirl fell to death from bridge after
sex claims](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8550390.stm)”:

> [[St Edward’s School](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Edward's_School,_Cheltenham)
> headmaster Dr Andrew Nash] said he had later been told of "unpleasant
> comments" about Holly which had been placed online and in text
> messages.

But that was not something the school knew about at the time, he said.

"Facebook is something we worry about because it is so completely outside of
our control," he added.

At least he’s honest.
