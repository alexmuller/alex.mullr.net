[Jeff Jarvis](http://www.buzzmachine.com/) was on an absolute roll during the
latest episode of [This Week in Google](http://twit.tv/twig), "A World of
Gibbons" ([#53](http://twit.tv/twig53),
[Huffduff](http://huffduffer.com/add?bookmark[url]=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.podtrac.com%2Fpts%2Fredirect.mp3%2Ftwit.cachefly.net%2Ftwig0053.mp3&bookmark[title]=This+Week+in+Google+-+53%3A+A+World+of+Gibbons)).
Some quotes, emphasis mine, with MP3 timecodes _[in square brackets]_:

> _[25:21]_ If you're sitting in any organisation, and let's not forget
> **this is not just going to be governments, it's also companies**. At
> some point, as I said earlier on, and it's a glib line, but the only
> sure cure for leaks is transparency. At some point you're gonna
> realise that you're better off releasing more information. That the
> more you hold secret, the more risk you have of leaks, and anything
> that looks like a leak looks like an expose. Now that's going to be a
> **very hard lesson to get across to controlling institutions**, but I
> think if we're looking at a long term impact here on the culture. I'm
> writing about this obviously, so it's on the top of my brain. But I
> think that this **default of publicness versus a default of privacy**
> and secrecy is what we're grappling with here, and we get to a point
> where there is no mediator.
> 
> _[33:26]_ So what the fear was, that they put forward is someone
> would come and scan your garbage. So what, they find out I'm 33
> now, not 32? Then what? What does that do? We don't look at the
> implications, but technology yields change and change yields fright
> and fright yields protection. And that's a very small example of
> what [Jay](http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/)
> just said. Whether you're a big institution, or whether you're a
> survivalist, or whoever you are, there's two responses to this world
> coming up: to embrace the change, or to try to fear it.

And the killerâ€¦

> _[34:22]_ Yes, we need secrets. But first you have to have the trust
> to know that those who are holding secrets are holding them for a
> reason.
