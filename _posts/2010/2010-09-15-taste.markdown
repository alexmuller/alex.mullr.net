Lots of seemingly-different-but-actually-related thoughts coming together
these last few weeks. What [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) said at
dConstruct seems to be underlying everything. Spoiler? It all comes down to
taste.

Aside: [Listen to the talks. All of them.](http://huffduffer.com/dConstruct/tags/dconstruct2010)

This email from university today [made me think about
this](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/status/24556042655) more. On top is the
email I received, below is how I would have written it.

![Email from York](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2010-09-15-halifax-email.png)

If you’re going to be given the ‘power’ to email several thousand students
with one click, somebody should be ensuring that you have the level of taste
required to do that properly. This person does not. Seriously: that’s the
entirety of the email she sent. No indication of who she was, why I received
it, where it came from (except the `from:` address). This isn’t rocket
science, it’s just that some people clearly have attention to detail
approaching zero in some situations.

This is something that’s coming up time and time again for me. It sounds
elitist and snobby, but I can’t think of a way around it: in situations where
lots of people can affect a single _thing_\*, there needs to be a gatekeeper.

\* A _thing_ can be a project, website, brand, or any number of other things.

In this case, her email is affecting the Halifax college or university brand -
and not in a good way. [YUSU](http://www.yusu.org/) is an organisation who
really look like they get this. Everything that I’ve seen come out of there
has been beautiful. From their weekly emails, to logos, to building signage
and their website. All the way down to whatever rubbish they’ll give out to
new students in a few weeks (key rings, calendars, pens, etc). It all _looks_
stunning. This is so important.

Taste, and attention to detail. I’m going to be thinking about them far more than ever before.
