At the end of 2008, [I posted a map of all the teenage homicides in
London](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/09/teenage-killings-in-london/) by
collating BBC News articles. This year, it was significantly easier; my
Freedom of Information request was returned by the Metropolitan Police’s
Performance Information Bureau yesterday, and here’s the map:

View [2009 Teenage Killings in
London](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=104812537703554849045.000480057b5fe5a4a643d&ll=51.529251,-0.092697&spn=0.170869,0.549316&z=11&source=embed)
in a larger map

The total number is down on last year, from 28 to 15. However, where there was
only one girl last year, there are three here. The mean age is between 17 and
18 years old, with the average age for the girls being just under two years
less.

This is what both sets of points (1st January 2008 to 31st December 2009)
together look like:

And both years in central London:

Thanks to the Met for taking the time to dig out this information for me. The
title of the report they provided is “_Names, Dates and Location of Homicide
Victims aged 13-19 between 1st Jan - 31 Dec 2009_”, FOI 2010 01 0002688.

([This](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8525923.stm) appeared on BBC
News two hours ago. I suppose I’ll have work to do next year too, then.)
