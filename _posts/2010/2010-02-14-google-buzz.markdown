I'm trying to like Google's latest offering, Buzz. Really, I am.

But when the front page looks like this for me, I can't keep on coming back
day after day. There are **22 shared Google Reader** items, which I need to
read in Google Reader because the rest of my feeds are there. There are **13
Google Buzz posts**, which I can only read in Buzz. And there are **4
tweets**, which I need to read on Twitter so that I can keep track of
everybody else I follow.

The content unique to Buzz is (comparatively) very small, and comes from an
incredibly tiny subset of my "social circle" (God, I hate that term).
