![Broadband Speed Chart](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2010-01-03-megabit-chart.png)

Our broadband speed has looked like this for the last ten years. Here’s hoping
we get to 50Mbps within the next year or two - and who knows where we’ll be in
another ten years.

Here’s where we’re going at the moment:

* BT is saying that 40% of homes will have the ability to have a 100Mbps
  connection by the 2012 Olympics:

* It’s possible to get 50Mbps from Virgin Media at the moment, for £30-£40 per
  month
* Virgin promise 100Mbps by 2010:
