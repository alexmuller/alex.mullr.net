_Disclaimer: this won’t be interesting if you’re one of those people who
thinks location-based services are “oversharing”._

The decision between whether to use foursquare or Gowalla is as difficult as
it’s ever been. I’m currently in the Gowalla camp, but seeing some of the
beautiful visualisations from WeePlaces.com ([here’s
mine](http://weeplaces.com/alex-muller1/)) has got me wavering. Because this
is what it’s all about, actually being able to see the data that we’re
ploughing into these services day after day. There’s been talk the last few
days ([summarised nicely by Jeremy](http://adactio.com/journal/1686/)) about
whether it’s worth trusting all our data to different corners of the web. And
it totally is, as long as we can **see** what it is we’re trusting them with.

This is what makes me giddy about people like [BERG](http://berglondon.com/);
they make [really pretty things](http://www.howbigreally.com/).

Here’s how London on [my GowallaWalk
map](http://gowallawalk.com/alexmuller/map/) looks just now:

As people far smarter than me have noted recently, this is where Twitter and
Facebook fail (damn, I can’t remember who I read this from). There’s no easy
way to see what I posted last Christmas, for example, on either of those
services. But I can easily see, on a shiny Google map, every place I’ve been
since January. I can see the distance I travelled with my family across South
Africa. The safari camps, restaurants, beaches and shops we went to. All of
which evoke memories. And that’s just plain cool.
