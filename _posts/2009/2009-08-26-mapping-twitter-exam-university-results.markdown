I’m a big fan of making pretty maps, so when I thought up an idea yesterday
morning, I had to see it through. For those who weren’t aware, last Thursday
was exam results day for loads of kids all over the country, the day they
found out where they’d be going to university. More than a few announced this
via Twitter (as you do these days, I guess); and as they were copying and
pasting from [“the results site”](http://ucas.com/), they were fairly easy to
find.

So I stitched together a Google map of the UK, and set to work putting the
points on a map; it made sense to do it by hand seeing as the sample size
wasn’t massive. And here’s the result (click through for a massive version if
you really feel like breaking your browser and my Amazon S3 account):

For reference, the blue dots map number of undergraduates against location.
Both maps should be scaled sort of properly (there’s the same amount of red as
there is blue, if my Maths hasn’t failed me). It was interesting to see how
the many more results came from the universities in the middle the country
when compared to their size.

And as though that wasn’t enough, I went and made you a
[Wordle](http://wordle.net/) of what subjects people are studying:

Oh, and I don’t claim that any of this is 100% certified guaranteed
scientifically accurate™. It was just a fun little project for the day. My
messy data’s [available as a
.csv](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-26-unitweets-data.csv)
should you wish to inspect it.
