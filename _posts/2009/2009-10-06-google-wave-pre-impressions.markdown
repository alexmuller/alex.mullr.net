Firstly, apologies for adding to the pile of Google Wave content that you’re
probably having to deal with at the moment.

I watched [the infamous hour long
video](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html#video) for the first time
last Sunday, and I’m blown away. I know Wave’s been knocking about for a
couple of months now, but before this week I’d never even considered it worth
the hour of watching the video. Right now, I’m wish I’d signed up for an
invite the first time I saw it.

The problem with Wave is that once you watch that video and understand what’s
going on, you’ll see use cases for it absolutely everywhere. I’ve got so many
email discussions going with two other people, which Wave would simplify
incredibly. Just yesterday, somebody said “we should get an email thread
started to bounce discussions around”. Wave makes **so** much more sense for
stuff like that. So now, I’ve signed up and am waiting on Google.

Sure, I still have reservations about it. I’m sure everybody does, to a
certain extent. But this really is the re-invention of email, and I wish I’d
given it the attention it deserved a few months ago. Lesson learned, Google,
lesson learned. You guys win again.
