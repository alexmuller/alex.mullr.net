![Access Denied from National Express](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-06-23-nxec-accessdenied.png)

Oh c'mon, National Express. Surely you've learnt by now that outright blocking
stuff isn't the answer. It doesn't _really_ prevent it, and actually just
pisses people off. Really, your Wi-Fi can't deal with a minute long YouTube
video? A DNS lookup later, and…

![And, working again!](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-06-23-nxec-youtube.png)

Blocking by domain name. Clever.

So, so frustrating that they block this 4MB YouTube download, but won't try to
stop me updating my browser (30MB) or downloading some video podcasts
(~100MB).
