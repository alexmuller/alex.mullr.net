I’ve spent the last couple of months working on a site for a new company,
Bedouin® – it was great experience, and really good fun. The site isn’t
particularly extensive, so it’s based on flat files rather than any kind of
content management system or database; though as it grows, that’s definitely
something to consider. The artwork was done by Zeke Wade, the design and
layout by Silas Grant, and the coding (PHP, HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript) by me.
The site works in IE6 with [surprisingly little
work](http://bedouinfoundry.com/bedouin_ie6.css) – my favourite part is it
serves a not-as-pretty GIF background if you’re using Internet Explorer 6 or
older instead of _any other browser_. And as any web developer knows, if it
works in IE6 it’ll work in just about anything else. Except IE5.

Feel free to check out the live site now, and make sure to admire the
beautiful illustrations: [Bedouin®](http://bedouinfoundry.com/).
