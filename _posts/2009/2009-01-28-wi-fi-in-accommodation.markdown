I was talking to [Michael](http://michaelstech.wordpress.com/) yesterday, and
we decided (I think I got this right) that university was really pretty cool
because at times we actually get a say in the way things work. Today, that was
verified as I got this reply back from the college administrator:

I was all ready to write this post dripping with praise for the college, and
the university and whatever, except I just got another reply explaining that
we don't have Wi-Fi because of the prohibitive cost. Really, "prohibitive
cost"?

![Campus Wi-Fi](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-01-28-campus-wifi.png)

The pink is where there's currently Wi-Fi available on campus. The blue is
where I asked for it. How is that more expensive to the point where it's not
possible?

Part of me is tempted to try and do something with this (meetings, petitions,
voting?) but another part of me thinks it isn't important enough to waste time
on.
