BT have a nice little thing on their multiple-choice-phone-help-service. If
you call back after you’ve previously reported a problem, they’ll spew this
automated message at you:

> I can see that a fault was recently reported for this number. If
> you're calling about that, press 1.

Minor, but timesaving. Their [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/BTCare) is
also helpful, if a little over-active (and unstoppable) at times. BT, as well
as O2 Broadband, you both have excellent customer service.
