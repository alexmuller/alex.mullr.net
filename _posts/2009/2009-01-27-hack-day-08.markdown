The Last.fm Hack Day took place last month, and I can't believe I didn't post
anything about it at the time.

[![Last.fm Hack Day](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3067/3109503067_caf8af4e84.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/russss/3109503067/)

It was a great day spent (for me) learning the basics of Python and, a
technical term here, "pissing about" with the Last.fm API. There was a
Microsoft Surface and Xboxes on hand to entertain us, and plenty of free food
and drink.

While I didn't accomplish anything particularly amazing (at the time, it was
noted that you could do everything I managed with the actual Last.fm website),
the environment was incredibly conducive to producing good code. Plus, some of
the people who were actually trying ([Your Next Favourite
Band](http://yournextfavband.com/)?) made some great little things. See [the
official Last.fm blog post](http://blog.last.fm/2008/12/22/hack-day-2008) for
links to all the apps.

Russ (from Last.fm) and I (and many, many others) both have

[photos](http://flickr.com/photos/alexmuller/3109888937/) on Flickr, though
his are just a little better. You can see a video that was created of the day
[on the group page](http://www.last.fm/group/Hack+Day), and I've put a copy
[on S3](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-01-26-hackday.flv)
in case the original disappears. And yes, unfortunately I do make an
appearance... :D
