I find it really interesting hearing people's thoughts on copyright, legality
and entitlement.

To summarise a conversation I had recently: It's a good thing Last.fm pays
artists; people like artists, and music, and want them to stick around
(shocking!). Last.fm isn't fluid enough at the moment, and is losing possible
users to (loosely defined) piracy because of it. And it's not obvious that
Last.fm is any more legal than Limewire.

The reason this is being dragged up now is because I received an invitation
for [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) from [Ernesto](http://torrentfreak.com/)
this evening. The complaints I've heard about Last.fm are that playing a song
sometimes takes too long and it simply doesn't have the catalog required to
keep people interested. Spotify, it seems, solves these problems. After doing
a couple of searches with people much more into shit _popular_ music than I
am, it passes the catalog test. It also passes the speed test, with songs
playing instantly - if you put this in front of someone, I'm not sure it would
be immediately apparent that it's an online service.

The best news? At the end of last month, Spotify announced that they support
scrobbling to Last.fm directly from the preferences of their application. The
two services can play brilliantly together. Whilst I won't be paying the £10 a
month for Spotify's premium service (hell, the adverts aren't even intrusive
or often), the UK-based scrobbling site should be glad to hear that they won't
be losing the £1.50 I pay them per month, either.
