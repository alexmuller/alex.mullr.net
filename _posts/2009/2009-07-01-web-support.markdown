While talking to [Adam](http://zethrae.us/) last night, he mentioned that a
certain online bookmarking company had been particularly unhelpful when he was
emailing their tech support. Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning
to find ‘Luke’ had updated my Twitter support ticket. I'm not sure whether
it's the person, the coders or the company, but something's crap here. This is
the story…

On the 8th of April I opened a ticket to let Twitter know that they'd spelt
[Twitterrific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/) incorrectly on
[their downloads page](http://twitter.com/downloads). Fine, it's a tiny
problem, and an easy fix, but nonetheless something that should be fixed.
‘andr8a’ replied within a day, and was very grateful.

Poking around towards the end of last month, the problem still hadn't been
sorted. Fine, another support ticket opened, how tough can this be to fix?
After jumping through hoops (they now close your ticket with a list of FAQs
without even reading it, _sigh_), this is the reply I was left with this
morning:

> Thanks. This will not be fixed at this time.

What the hell? How hard is it to fix one typo on their own site? And I didn't
need an essay back, but did he have to sound so pissed off when I was clearly
trying to help? Thanks, Twitter. You guys _rock_.
