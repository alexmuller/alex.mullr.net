Dear Apple,

[![iPhone Settings](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-07-03-iphone-settings.png)](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-07-03-iphone-settings.png)

[![iPhone Last.fm Settings](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-07-03-iphone-lastfm.png)](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-07-03-iphone-lastfm.png)

I've had my iPhone almost a year now. It's been out for a little over
twenty-four months, if I can add up right. Is there a decent reason that I
have still have to jump through hoops to add music I play to Last.fm? Sure,
Last.fm is a comparatively small site^1 - but you're touting Facebook and
Flickr exporting features as a pretty major upgrade to iPhoto. Plus, I can't
imagine that something like this would be particularly difficult for you guys
to code.

It's not like scrobbling is really data-intensive, either. Basically, I just
don't see why you haven't done it yet.

Cheers,

Alex
