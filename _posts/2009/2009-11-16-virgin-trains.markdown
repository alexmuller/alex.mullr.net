![Virgin Trains on Twitter](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-11-16-VirginTrains.png)

As much as stuff like this shouldn’t affect my opinion of a company, it’s
pretty nice to open up Tweetie on iPhone and see a reply from Virgin asking
how my train journey is going. Wonder what the critical mass of companies
using Twitter is before this starts getting annoying, and how long until we
get there.
