I only just saw [this Guardian
video](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/dec/11/snapshot-special-branch-terror-suspect)
of a stop and search because of filming near the entrance of the Gherkin in
London.

If you’re rushed, start at 2:45 in:

> _Plain clothes police officer:_ I’m going to take a note of your details
> under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act. Do you understand that? _Journalist:_
> Is this an official search? _Plain clothes police officer:_ Not a search, no,
> I'm taking your details to find out exactly what you’re doing.

You can go and read Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 if you want. [It’s
not very
long](http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_5#pt5-pb2-l1g44).
I think that police officer should probably give it another going over before
citing it so easily.

> (2) An authorisation under this subsection authorises any constable in
> uniform to stop a pedestrian in an area or at a place specified in the
> authorisation and to search— (a) the pedestrian; (b) anything carried by him.

Percentage of Section 44 which this officer understands?

Zero.

Respect I have for him, and by extension the Metropolitan Police, after
watching this video?

Um. Yeah.

If you’re interested in seeing more, Cory’s got [another great
video](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/15/photographer-beaten.html).
