Having spent the last few weeks in the US with a [bunch](http://zethrae.us/)
of [people](http://www.michaelhenley.co.uk/), I wanted to take the opportunity
to go through where we stayed, what we did and all those hamburgers we ate.

For the five days we spent in New York, we stayed at [![The Pod
Hotel](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-14-pod-hotel.png)](http://www.thepodhotel.com/)
([![Dopplr](http://dopplr.com/favicon.ico)](http://www.dopplr.com/place/us/ny/new-york/stay/the-pod-hotel)).
It's pretty much right in the middle of Manhattan, the perfect spot for
complete tourists like we were, and it wasn't _too_ expensive (the two of us
paid $660 for a shared room for four nights). The rooms are pretty small and
modern [![Pod Hotel

and there's an amazing view from their rooftop garden [![Pod Hotel

In terms of touristy things, we visited the [![Empire State
Building](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-14-empire-state-building.png)](http://www.esbnyc.com/index2.cfm)
([![Dopplr](http://dopplr.com/favicon.ico)](http://www.dopplr.com/place/us/ny/new-york/explore/the-empire-state-building))
and [![Statue of
Liberty](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-14-statue-of-liberty.png)](http://www.statuecruises.com/)
([![Dopplr](http://dopplr.com/favicon.ico)](http://www.dopplr.com/place/us/ny/new-york/explore/statue-of-liberty)).
Both were great days out and (like the hotel) not as expensive as I'd feared
they might be. $20 each maybe, something like that. We also donated a couple
of dollars to see [![Metropolitan Museum of
Art](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-metmuseum.png)](http://www.metmuseum.org/)
(hey, it's <del>suggested</del> actually mandatory).

For food, just wow. We ate in so many perfectly stereotypical American places,
and to be honest I never want to see a burger again. [![TGI
Fridays](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-tgi-fridays.png)](http://www.fridays.com/)
reminds me of a burger soaked/fried in oil,
[![Houston's](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-houstons.png)](http://www.hillstone.com/#/restaurants/houstons/)
conjures memories of the most ridiculously oversized steak.
[Mimi](http://twitter.com/mimikojakovic) thought that
[![RubyTuesday](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-ruby-tuesday.png)](http://www.rubytuesday.com/)
was really good when she went there, but we didn't have a chance to this time.
For some reason, I feel the need to point out that it wasn't all massive
expensive steak;
[![Matsu](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-matsu-sushi.png)](http://matsusushinyc.com/)
([![Dopplr](http://dopplr.com/favicon.ico)](http://www.dopplr.com/place/us/ny/new-york/eat/matsu-sushi))
was a great little sushi place that we discovered just round the corner from
our hotel, using New York Magazine's great [restaurant
finder](http://nymag.com/restaurants/). We also went to [![Hard Rock
Cafe](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-hardrockcafe.png)](http://www.hardrock.com/),
but while my honey glazed chicken sandwich (see, now my mouth's watering) was
delicious, apparently the rest of our food wasn't up to much. [![Dylan's Candy
Bar](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-dylans.png)](http://www.dylanscandybar.com/)
is, as the name suggests, full of three floors of expensive candy.

In San Diego, two places stick out more than the rest. Firstly, [![In-N-Out
Burger](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-in-n-out.png)](http://in-n-out.com/)
because everyone on the west coast has been raving about it for ages. They're
definitely not wrong, it was gorgeous. Second,
[![Peohe's](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-18-peohes.png)](http://www.peohes.com/)
was the meal we had on our final night, and it was a really nice place.

Wow, I never thought so much of this post would be about food. Well, when in
Romeâ€¦

If you're planning a trip, I'd recommend any of the places above. Thanks for
having us, America, this was great fun.
