St Paul’s School updated the installation of their Content Management System,
Firefly.NET, a couple of weeks ago. Along with this update they included a new
template that I built, changing the layout of the Intranet which had been
there since, I believe, 2001. Here’s a few screenshots to compare the two:

This redesign made use of Firefly.NET’s template architecture, so the template
files were built with XSLT and various stylesheets. While the old template was
built using tables (back in 2001, I imagine this was fairly common), the
update changes to use `<div>`s and more common stylesheet positioning instead.
It’s _technically_ HTML5, in that the first line of every document is
`<!doctype html>`, though this doesn’t really mean anything for the time
being. My favourite part of the redesign? The name of the school now has a
proper apostrophe (`St Paul’s` vs. `St Paul's`). Apparently I can be a little
picky.

[Firefly.NET](http://www.fireflysolutions.co.uk/fireflynet) is the system St
Paul’s has been using to manage content on its website and Intranet for quite
a while now. It was developed by two former pupils of the school, [Joe
Mathewson](http://twitter.com/j0ejack) and [Simon
Hay](http://twitter.com/sjehay). You can read more about their work and their
clients on the [Firefly Solutions site](http://www.fireflysolutions.co.uk/).
