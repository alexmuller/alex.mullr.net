On the train back to York from [Last.fm's Hack
Day](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2009/01/hack-day-08/) last year,
[Alice](http://twitter.com/AliceBartlett/) introduced me to pixel art (her
post on [Guess Who](http://alicebartlett.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/guess-who/)
is a great example of this style). At the time, I remember making some comment
about how she'd effectively ruined my degree because making pictures of people
from dots of colour would be my life from then on. To be honest, it never
really caught on with me - I think I'm just naturally crap at drawing people.

However, that's all just changed. I found a thread on a music site entitled
"MS Paint Your Favorite Album", encouraging users to recreate the front covers
of iconic or important albums (to them) using the standard Paint included with
Windows.

If you've got thirty minutes or an hour spare, it's a really great way to
spend some time. I wanted something simple to start with, and I think this
turned out pretty well.

So, give it a go: Microsoft Paint if you're on Windows, the open source
[Paintbrush](http://paintbrush.sourceforge.net/) if you're on a Mac. No
layers, no fancy text tools, no nothing. Brush, line tool, eraserâ€¦ and get to
it, without forgetting to post the results somewhere.
