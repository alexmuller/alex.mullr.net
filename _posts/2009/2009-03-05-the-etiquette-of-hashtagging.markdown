A few days ago on Twitter, I wrote this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I just don't get why <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523people">#people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523hashtag">#hashtag</a> every <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523shitting">#shitting</a> word in their <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523tweet">#tweet</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523makesnosense">#makesnosense</a>.</p>&mdash; Alex Muller (@alexmuller) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmuller/status/1254068954" data-datetime="2009-02-26T15:59:09+00:00">February 26, 2009</a></blockquote>

Hashtags are "a community-driven convention for adding additional context and
metadata to your tweets." To see what I mean about normal words being tagged,
go to [search.twitter.com](http://search.twitter.com/), pick a random word and
put a hash sign in front of it.

Updates like [this](http://twitter.com/Ponx/statuses/1215888455) annoy me,
because there's absolutely no need to tag normal words in a tweet. For every
person on Twitter who's versed in all things #, there are many more who
haven't had the trend explained to them. This means there are people tweeting
both "#episode" and "episode", so we've got two terms that need to be searched
for to find tweets relating to TV.

I've seen some nice Twitter guidelines in the last couple of weeks (some on
[corporate usage](http://www.frankieroberto.com/weblog/1426) spring to mind),
so I thought I'd have a go at some for hashtagging...

### When should I tag?

There are a couple of things in this category:

* When at an event, or a gathering of people - or trying to keep track of an
  event. [Future of Web Apps](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23fowa) and
  [The Pirate Bay's trial](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2523spectrial)
  are two that have worked quite well in the past.
* When Twitter's search might not give proper results for a phrase.
  [#safari4](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2523safari4) was one from
  yesterday, as I suppose "Safari 4" could give some strange results.

### And when should I not?

Essentially...

* When the search function on Twitter will give you exactly the same result. I
  cannot see the point in
  [#plurk](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2523plurk) or
  [#youtube](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2523youtube). I suppose #lost
  (for the TV show) does make some sense, as it's trying to differentiate from
  people just using the word "lost".
