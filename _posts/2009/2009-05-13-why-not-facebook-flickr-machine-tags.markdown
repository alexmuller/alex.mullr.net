So, tell me this... why has Flickr not implemented Facebook profile tagging on
its photos, the same way it does with Last.fm or Upcoming events?

Tagging a photo with, say, `facebook:profile=012345678` would add a link to
that person's Facebook profile, and could then be used (effectively in
reverse) on Facebook profiles.

**June 6th:** Since writing this post, I've come across a really cool [Flickr
machine tag browser](http://husk.org/code/machine-tag-browser.html) that you
should check out.
