Earlier this week, news that Nottinghamshire teacher Peter Harvey was arrested
for the attempted murder of one of his students broke. BBC News [is now
reporting](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8145486.stm)
that he's been remanded in custody.

Regardless of what you make of the story, it should be obvious that details
are a little sketchy; things have only been going for a few days or so, and
nothing major has got out yet.

Nevertheless, some people have managed to prove their stupidity by offering
completely unwanted and idiotic opinions on social networking sites like
Facebook. Here's a couple that made me cringe:

> Jack Waterhouse looks like a little shit that deserves beatings.

-- from the [Facebook group of the same
name](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=98973423902), by one Scott Haynes.

> You are a hero to the average, respectable, working man. Kick these little
> gobshites back to their chavy council estates. Another fooking kid whose
> mother is sponging off the state

-- [Phil Mcavity](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000062715476)

> Jack Waterhouse is almost certainly a fresh-mouthed little smart arse that
> needed a good slapping. I blame the (single) mother.

-- [John Fitzgerald](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=705651846)

Apologies for the language and distasteful comments, but I wanted to get this
across. Why people think they have a right to do this on the Internet is
totally beyond me - it's not even like they're doing it because of anonymity.
It's ridiculous; part of me hopes it's illegal, because frankly I'd love to
see what would happen if some of these people had legal proceedings taken
against them.

* * *

Oh, I couldn't help but update this post after seeing the latest comment on
the original group, linked above:

> He looks like a right cheeky shit , unaware of who his father is.. what the
class put that teacher through was awful, no respect at all

That from [Jake William James
French](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=686435389) of Coquet High
School, Newcastle. No offence Jake, but if we're judging based on looks--as
I'd guess you yourself are--your profile picture doesn't seem much better.

**13th July, 1am:** I keep telling myself there's no point arguing with
trolls, and there's no point arguing with idiots. I need to spend less time on
Facebook, before it drives me insane. [Joe
Jimothy](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1288956974), from the
<del>lovely</del> state of Pennsylvania, has this to say:

> In my country we would have stoned him.

Really, Joe? Stoning's legal in the US, is it? Moron.
