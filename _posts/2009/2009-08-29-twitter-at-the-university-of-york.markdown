Figured it'd be useful to have a list of people actively using Twitter who are
somewhat related to the University of York. I've never been a great fan of
["groups"](http://www.twibes.com/), so this is my way of getting the
information out there.

### Groups, Societies and Other Things That Aren't People

* @[yusu](http://twitter.com/yusu): Yep, our student union's on Twitter. Oh,
   and they've got a [shiny new site](http://www.yusu.org/) to go along with
   the start of the academic year.
* @[UniOfYork](http://twitter.com/UniOfYork): The main official account, as
  far as I can tell. @[infocentre](http://twitter.com/infocentre), the
  university information centre, is also on Twitter.
* @[ChemistryatYork](http://twitter.com/ChemistryatYork): In case you happen
  to be doing… well, Chemistry at York, I guess.
* @[ystv](http://twitter.com/ystv): York Student Television, a society at the
  university.
* @[yorknouse](http://twitter.com/yorknouse): Nouse, the student-run
  newspaper, and its sister account
  @[nouselive](http://twitter.com/nouselive).
* @[theyorkeruk](http://twitter.com/theyorkeruk): The Yorker, another student
  media group at the university.

### Some People I Like

From the student union: @[tfngwena](http://twitter.com/tfngwena), the student
union President for this year, as well as the other account,
@[yusuprez](http://twitter.com/yusuprez). And
@[lewbee](http://twitter.com/lewbee), Democracy and Services officer at YUSU
this year.

From Computer Science, there's a whole load of people:
@[jalada](http://twitter.com/jalada) and @[x5315](http://twitter.com/x5315),
@[miketomasello](http://twitter.com/miketomasello),
@[amit_sinha](http://twitter.com/amit_sinha),
@[aJanuary](http://twitter.com/aJanuary). And from
[YSTV](http://ystv.york.ac.uk/), @[njhowell](http://twitter.com/njhowell),
@[brehonia](http://twitter.com/brehonia) and
@[annabucks](http://twitter.com/annabucks)
![](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2009-08-29-twitter-padlock.gif).

### And Finally…

Some people who technically aren't related to the university any more, but
they're pretty funny. And hey, they used to have lectures and seminars and
whatnot…

* @[tomscott](http://twitter.com/tomscott), last year's SU President. Mainly
  because he makes things which somehow all happen to be quite cool.
* @[unnamedculprit](http://twitter.com/unnamedculprit): I guess he could be
  described as Tom's partner in crime. I'm not sure that definition's
  accurate, but oh well.
* @[pearfalse](http://twitter.com/pearfalse): See, now I can't decide where
  the line between being a university student and not being one is…
* @[cnorthwood](http://twitter.com/cnorthwood), technical director for the
  student newspaper last year.
* @[AliceBartlett](http://twitter.com/AliceBartlett): a graduate with a job. I
  feel like I should be surprised that I know a graduate **with a job**.

* * *

If I've done this right, <del>everybody</del> most people linked to above
should have an unprotected account and be relatively active on Twitter. Most
of them will make you laugh, which is just a bonus. Sorry for how
spammy-looking this post is, but hopefully it'll be useful to someone. Don't
think I've forgotten anybody, but it wouldn't surprise me… let me know if I
have.
