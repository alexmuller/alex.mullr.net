Last Saturday, I went to the
[Hackspace::Leeds](http://leeds.hackspace.org.uk/) Hack Day, organised by the
Leeds branch of Hackspace, and supported by the Hackspace Foundation.

The day was split into hardware and software, and I went for the latter.
Hardware’s never particularly appealed, requires far too much dexterity. I
worked with [Chris](http://www.pling.org.uk/) on the UI and front-end for [The
Open Leeds project](http://www.openleeds.org.uk/), which is a group of people
who are just getting started, making historical data about Leeds accessible.
(If someone wants to work on something like this for London - or if something
like this is already going on - I’d love to get involved).

I wish there’d been more time, as we only managed to end up with a basic
structure and layout for the site, and a promise that we’d all continue work
on the mailing list. Below are a few screenshots as the day progressed.
