I've wished for a while that I had a camera and lens that could do [tilt-shift
photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_photography), but I think
I've found a site that will tide me over until I win the lottery or get a

photos and have them converted to look like they were originally taken in a
tilt-shift style. Obviously they're not going to look nearly as good as a
