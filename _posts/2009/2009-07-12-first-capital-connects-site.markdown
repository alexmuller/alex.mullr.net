Hey, [First Capital Connect](http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/) - we need
to talk.

You know databases, right? Those things that can store a whole load of data
for you? Yeah, start using them properly. Don't send me my [password cleartext
in an email](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/statuses/790639187), and don't
send it all uppercase when that's not how I entered it. Do you even support
case-sensitive passwords?

Oh, and find the guy who designed this part of your UI, take him out back and
beat him up a little:

> â€¦simply untick the box.

Which box?
