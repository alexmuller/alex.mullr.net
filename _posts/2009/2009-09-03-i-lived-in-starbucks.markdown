I’m somewhat compulsive when it comes to hoarding and keeping things. Here’s
all my Starbucks receipts from 2008 (which I can safely say are now where they
belong, in the bin).

Taking cues from sites like [Information is

my ability to display data, and really just make things that look pretty.
There’s definite progress being made on that front.
