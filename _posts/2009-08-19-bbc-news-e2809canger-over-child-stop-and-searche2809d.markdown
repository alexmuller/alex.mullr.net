> The mother of a nine-year-old boy has lodged a complaint after her son
> was stopped and searched by police.

[BBC News, August 18th, 2009](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8206546.stm)

So let's take a look at the facts here:
	
1. > with friends in **Camberwell, south London**
2. > Police are legally able to search children under the age of 10
3. > "Looking at him you can see he is not a suspect," she added.
4. > "It is not possible for a nine-year-old to commit a criminal offence."
5. > Jadan Shepherd was searched while he was sitting on a wall

But:

1. South London isn't a particularly nice place; and that's not just me being stereotypical and rude. Take a look at [South London Press Today](http://www.southlondon-today.co.uk), or the map I created of [teenage killings in London](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/09/teenage-killings-in-london/).
2. That doesn't mean they should, sure - but they absolutely can. From the kick off, she doesn't seem to have much of a leg to stand on.
3. No, Sandra, **you** think he's not a suspect. Because he's your son. To me, my friends, the police and everyone else, he probably looks as thuggish as every other kid. Maybe more, maybe less.
4. Whoop-di-fucking-do. We should definitely let all the nine-year-olds out there just walk around with knives that they've picked up from home then. In fact, let's start handing them out. Jesus. Also, this quote is stupid; common sense dictates that it **is** possible for a nine-year-old to **commit** a criminal offence, but it's not possible to convict them for it. [IANAL](http://www.google.com/search?q=IANAL) and all that.
5. He's called Jadan Shepherd. Kidding, kidding, that's not a reason. Kind of.
