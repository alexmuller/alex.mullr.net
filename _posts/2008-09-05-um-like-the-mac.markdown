Seeing as people seem to be asking this the whole time at the moment, have a
run-down of the Mac apps I need, use and love. And leave any I've forgotten in
the comments if you feel like it. Because I'm a student, and we're all totally
stereotypically broke, I'm going to go for the free stuff...

**[Perian](http://perian.org/)?** Remember that we're students, meaning that
we're all vile people who download movies illegally or watch porn or do some
other video related crap with our computers. Install this open-source set of
video codecs and watch your problems disappear. Also consider installing
[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) as an alternative video player.

**[Growl](http://growl.info/)?** A system-wide notification system. I get
pinged for instant messages, file downloads finishing, new things being posted
to Twitter. It's shiny, pretty and there's no reason not to have it.

**[Adium](http://adiumx.com/)?** The best IM application out there. Really, I
don't even need to justify it. If you can find me something better today, I'll
eat something a lot more interesting than my hat.

**[Quicksilver](http://www.blacktree.com/)?** This takes some getting your
head around. To start, think of it as a nicer Spotlight. Start playing with
plugins and triggers (I'll hand you over to [Merlin
Mann](http://www.43folders.com/) for that) and things only get better.

**[Firefox](http://firefox.com/)?** Safari works, but I prefer this.
Extensions win it for me, easily.

**[Google](http://www.google.com/mac/)** have some nice stuff for the Mac up
on their site. Take a peek.

That's my list. Let me know if I missed anything...
