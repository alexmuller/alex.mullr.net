Here's something to consider (especially at this time of year, with oodles of
cards being sent by post): Royal Mail tend to wrap their post bundles with red
rubber bands, a fact which won't be news to most people who live in London.
Mainly because they drop them all over the damn road.

The map portion to the right is of a road just near where I live. The pink
highlighted part is about 200 metres long, and on average I guess you'd expect
to see maybe two or three rubber bands on a road that size; I certainly did
this morning, but people can correct me if I'm wrong. On the map below, the
same distance is highlighted again... so, extrapolating the data, we might
expect to see perhaps thirty or fourty discarded on the pavement in an area
the size of this map. That's a guess, and in my mind it's on the low side.

Fine, that's all well and good. Except the map extract below shows how small
that part of London is. Here it is in comparison to most of west London:

For the record, you can fit about 250 of the small pink rectangles in that map
(as long as my Maths ability hasn't totally left me). Does this mean that
there could be 7,500 in west London? I'm doing the sums logically (as far as I
can tell), but I don't believe the numbers. Help me out here if I'm doing
something ridiculous.

A bit of crappy weighing suggests that these bands are about half a gram each.
7,500 per day in one part of London suggests somewhere round 3.5 kilograms of
rubber. Three and a half kilograms of rubber **a day**? I wonder whether they
pick them upâ€¦

In case you think I'm making a massive deal out of nothing, take a look at
