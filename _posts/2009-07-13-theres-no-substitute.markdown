There's no substitute for this kind of marketing, this direct contact with
customers. They're not even employees of the company; the [Twitter
bio](http://twitter.com/IN_N_OUT_Burger) reads:

> We are Former Managers for IN-N-OUT BURGER, we are not from the corp. office

[California beckons](http://www.dopplr.com/trip/alexmuller/560839), and I
can't wait.

In-N-Out: you have a pretty big reputation to live up to, and I really hope
you taste as good as you tweet.
