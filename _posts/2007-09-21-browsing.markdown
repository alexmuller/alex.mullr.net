Looking round the computer room, it's a shame to see the number of people
still using IE6 instead of the latest version of Firefox - either they don't
know it's installed here, or they just don't use it.

Unfortunate that the only alternative is Internet Explorer 6 - **IE7**, while
still far from perfect, is at least better.

And most of all, I pity the poor people who don't have tabbed browsing -
honestly can't remember how I coped before itâ€¦
