Merlin Mann:

> You’re gonna die, you’re gonna die, and nobody’s gonna care which version of
> the iPhone you used to make something on Twitter. […] I personally feel most
> alive when I’m making something. […] You can buy the jogging shoes, but until
> you put them on and walk out the door every day, you’re just a fat man.

And my favourite?

> Reading all the sex manuals in the world is not gonna to do anything until
> you’re touching genitals.
