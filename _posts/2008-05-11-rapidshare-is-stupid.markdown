Don't know if you've seen this or not, but Rapidshare's latest
[captcha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) is the stupidest thing I've
ever seen. I mean honestly, it took me the best part of a minute to figure
out.

Seriously? Type the letters that have a cat next to them? Which idiot came up
with that?
