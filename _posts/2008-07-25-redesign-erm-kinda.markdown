I've just switched over to a new template. For the most part it'll look the
same as the old one, but should be a little wider (wooo, more space for
content). The good news for me is that it's no longer based on a version of
Kubrick that shipped with something like Wordpress 2.x, it's based on some
[blank Wordpress themes](http://www.refueled.net/blank-wordpress-themes/).

It may look a little funky for a while. I'll be changing some things live, so
leave a comment if something screws up majorly (and you can be bothered)...

I've gone for supporting a minimum screen resolution of 1024x768 and not
testing in IE6, which seem fair given how Google Analytics looks.

Cheers ;)
