[![Should York email and calendar take to the clouds?](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-10-22-yorkcloud.jpg)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-10-22-yorkcloud.jpg)

Well... I made it to the University of York, and survived Freshers' Week;
making my way through two fire alarms, a few dozen pints of Guinness and more
free Dominos pizza than I care to remember.

The newsy-thing that came up today is the flyer that's displayed to the right
- UoY's Computing Services are asking for people's opinions on migrating the
University email and calendar setup to Google Apps for Education or
Microsoft's Live@Edu. This is huge for me. Not only is it a fairly large
(thousands of students) organisation considering migrating to the cloud within
the next couple of years, they're actively soliciting opinions from
**students**. I'm so pleased to see things heading in this direction.

The [URL](http://www.york.ac.uk/taketotheclouds/) on the flyer requires a
University of York login.

Also: Oh God, I hope I don't piss people off by posting this... ;]
