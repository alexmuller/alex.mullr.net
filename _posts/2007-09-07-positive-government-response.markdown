Positive? – no, I haven't gone crazy just yet. A little over a month ago I got
an email from "10 Downing Street" saying that the Government had responded to
an online petition with almost 3000 signatures, asking for the piccadilly line
to stop at Turnham Green station. They responded with a complete
we-can't-be-bothered cop-out:

> Responsibility for London Underground (LU) transferred from the
> Department for Transport to Transport for London (TfL) and ultimately
> the Mayor in July 2003. It is for LU and not the Government to
> determine the service patterns and timetabling on the underground
> network.
>
> This issue would be best directed to the London Underground
> Stakeholder Communications Team at 55 Broadway, London, SW1H 0BD.

However, yesterday I received a response about a petition asking for the BBC's
iPlayer to be available for other operating systems then Microsoft's Windows –
this was [the reply](http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page13090.asp):

> ...the Trust noted the strong public demand for the service to be
> available on a variety of operating systems. The BBC Trust made it
> a condition of approval for the BBC's on-demand services that the
> iPlayer is available to users of a range of operating systems, and has
> given a commitment that it will ensure that the BBC meets this demand
> as soon as possible. They will measure the BBC's progress on this

Much more positive – perhaps it does work after all…
