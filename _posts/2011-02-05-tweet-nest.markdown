That’s now a lie. I installed [Tweet Nest](http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/)
on my VPS^1 a few weeks ago, and it's been happily pulling in my
poorly-worded thoughts since.

[My Tweet Nest install](http://lighfe.mullr.net/tweetnest/) is all set up, so
new tweets are loaded with a PHP script and cron. You can view by month and
date, and the search is rather bloody good. I’m a huge fan.
