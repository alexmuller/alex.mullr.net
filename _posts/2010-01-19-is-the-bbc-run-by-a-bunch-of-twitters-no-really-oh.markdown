I saw some of the talk about the Express article on the BBC’s Twitter
presence, but never bothered to go in search and read it. After seeing [Rowan

I had to see the original.

Oh. The Express site reports that:

> The article you are looking for does not exist. It may have been deleted.

Pffft. They’ve already lost my respect, but they could have perhaps clawed a
tiny part back by leaving a proper apology in its place.

So, now I wanted to see the original even more. It’s fantastic; here you go:
