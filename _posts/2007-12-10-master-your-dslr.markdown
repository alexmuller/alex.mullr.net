End of school term means hardly any work to do, so I spent the evening playing
with (learning?) my dad's **Nikon D80**, seeing as I had pretty much no clue
how to use it before now. I've been through Lifehacker's tutorials ([part
one](http://lifehacker.com/software/feature/master-your-dslr-camera-part-1-program-mode-323605.php)
and [part
two](http://lifehacker.com/software/feature/master-your-dslr-camera-part-2-manual-mode-and-more-328488.php))
on mastering your digital SLR in both Program and Manual mode.

Here's all I've managed so far today (bearing in mind I've been sitting at a
desk all evening) - and neither of these have any kind of post-processing. I
realise it's all pretty poor, but I'm having really good fun learning it. The
first is taken on full automatic (noticing the yellow tint of the picture):

The second is with the white balance adjusted "manually" (noticing how the
white MacBook is actually white):

So now I'm asking myself: why the hell didn't I try and learn this before??
Looking forward to many days over the Christmas holidays spent out and about,
just taking pictures and experimenting. That Flickr Pro account might finally
pay offâ€¦
