It's half one in the morning, so the obvious thing to do was to post about how
much I want to sleepâ€¦

Firstly: PowerPoint for the Mac is a pile of steaming horribleness - I can't
find a way (right now at least) to make it do a presentation on my widescreen
laptop... so I'm using Keynote, which I don't know half as well - though the
presentation doesn't look half bad

Secondly: Facebook has now been encoding my video for the last two hours -
that would be fine, except that this is a 1MB, 20 second cameraphone clip...
hardly HD taxing

**Edit:** Thirdly: Wordpress just screwed up all the paragraph formatting on
this, so I had to fix it... why now???
