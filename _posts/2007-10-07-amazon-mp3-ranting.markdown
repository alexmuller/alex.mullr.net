Just got this buying an album from Amazon's MP3 service - looks like they
"fixed" the bug where people outside the US could buy music:

> We are sorry...
>

Don't worry Amazon, no inconvenience to me... guess I'll have to think of somewhere else to get my music from.

Oh look at that, iTunes doesn't have the full album. eMusic have it, but I'm
not signing up for a subscription. And Napster have it, but it'll be a cold
day in hell when I buy WMA DRM'd music. Fucking ridiculous, excusing my
language. **I want to give you my money, please take it from me...**

Yours Sincerely,

A very pissed off (but $8.90 richer) Alex
