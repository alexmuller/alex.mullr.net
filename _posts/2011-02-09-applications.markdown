As part of my placement at GSK, I’ve been helping look at the job applications
for next year’s version of me. Here are a few things that I didn’t realise
when I was applying last February, but which I’d definitely change if I had to
do it all over again.

Note that I’m just me; if you’re looking for “Company Policy”, you’re most
definitely in the wrong place. I’m (thankfully and obviously!) not the only
person looking at these applications and I don’t have a huge amount of
experience, but I’d like to think I might know what’s good in a job
application for a front-end web person:

1. If you have a decent, established web presence (i.e. you have a site and
    search results for your name contain more than one that’s obviously about
    you): **link to yourself all over the bloody application**. That might be
    going a little far, but definitely use your own domain as a contact email
    address and link to your site if there’s an ‘additional information’ section.
    It puts you ahead of the competition. Bonus points if your site actually has
    decent content and seems well looked-after.
2. **Module results don’t really matter**: that doesn’t mean anybody could
    get 2 GCSEs and just pop right in. But first-year results aren’t as important
    as I was led to believe, for this specific job at least. I reckon that having
    loads of web-related experience is much more important than doing 10% better
    at university.
3. **PROOFREAD & SPELLCHECK.** Seriously. The number of applications that
    come in with things like “Glaxosmithkline” or “Glaxo smithkline” is
    terrifying. I’m sounding picky; but if you can’t get the name of the company
    you’re applying for right, why bother?
