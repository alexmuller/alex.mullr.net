This was slightly too long to [tweet](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/) about,
but I needed to get it out of my system:

**If somebody has a disgusting habit, I can cope. If somebody has a disgusting
habit and proceeds to drop their litter from it all over the place, I get
really irritated.**

For some reason, a [cigarette](http://flickr.com/photos/beevek/14260583/)
packet outside Gunnersbury tube station today pushed me over the edge a little
bit. No worries, I didn't do anything weird. It just made me think about it.
