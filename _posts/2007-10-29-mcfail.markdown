McDonalds just doesn't seem to get it. In the UK, specifically London (and
possibly elsewhere) they've just given all their "restaurants" a facelift,
changing the colour and material from tacky red and yellow to what looks like
green wood. Yes, they do look nicer - they don't give you quite the cornea
pain they used to. But the fact is that consumers are starting to realise (I
hope) that the quality of the food is pretty far below decent.

Please, McDonalds, please improve the actual meals as well. It's badly needed,
and I think we've got to a point where people are willing to pay a little bit
more for it (see: **[Nandos](http://www.nandos.co.uk/)**).

This [Guardian article](http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2118676,00.html) from the
beginning of July this year mentions the redesign. Fact is, I've only seen it
happening round [where I
live](http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&ll=51.496775,-0.275688&spn=0.115205,0.327873&z=12&om=1)
in the last week or so. I haven't been in for a nice long time, so Marianne
Barriaux can probably describe the interior better than I canâ€¦
