Last night I [went to see](http://www.last.fm/event/297614) Hellogoodbye, Say
Anything, Go:Audio and Sherwood at the **Carling Academy Brixton**. Honestly,
first gig I've ever been to, and it was **so much fun**. I actually can't hear
a thing right now, which isn't great - but long-term, that's got to be worth
it.

[Made Up Stories](http://www.last.fm/music/Go%3AAudio/_/Made+Up+Stories)
wasn't bad, coming from a band I'd never heard of before, and Say Anything
ending with [Alive With The Glory of
Love](http://www.last.fm/music/Say+Anything/_/Alive+With+The+Glory+of+Love)
wasâ€¦ I want to use the word **awesome**, but feel like I've been saying it too
much recently.

And then Hellogoodbye came on. To put it one way, you'd be pretty hard pressed
to make me find a song that they played that wasn't **fantastic**. I'm
completely wow'ed, a [shock and
awe](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shock_and_awe&oldid=170581929#Popular_culture)
kinda moment. Everyone warned me that once I started listening to the "normal"
songs again they just wouldn't do it anymore, and now I see how right people
were. They sound tinny and unfulfilling, which is such a shame - the
associated positive effect is that I'll just have to go and see them again
live sometime - the negative is that this is their last tour for a while, to
give them time to work on a new album.

**Little update:** Somebody's posted three
