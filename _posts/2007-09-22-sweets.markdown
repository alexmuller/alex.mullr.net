Since I've had very little (free) time in London since the end of June, I only
just started going through my "goodie bag" from the open day at Imperial
College. One tiny thing that I really love is a tin that contains miniature
smarties – this is tough to explain, but you click the middle to open it, and
squish the outside to lock it. I don't know if these tins are called anything
in particular. [Video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvMlt43r8Ws).
