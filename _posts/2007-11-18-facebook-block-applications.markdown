I could be completely wrong with this, but when Facebook says prevents this
application from retrieving **any** information about you, could that include
the fact that you even exist? I say that because I've been getting three or
four invitations for both "Human Pets" and "PetrolHeads" every day for the
last few weeks now, and since blocking the applications I haven't received
any. What can I say, I'm a happier
[Facebookian](http://www.google.com/search?q=facebookian) for it.
