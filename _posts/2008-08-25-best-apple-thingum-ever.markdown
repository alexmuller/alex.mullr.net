Take an Airport Express connected by the headphone jack to some decent
speakers downstairs, and leave your computer on upstairs.

Use the [Remote](http://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/) application on the
iPhone or iPod touch from downstairs - it can browse and play the iTunes
library on the computer, but it can also change the output speakers so that
you're streaming the music to your nice audio setup. It's a Sonos, but
comparatively cheap (and yes, lacking features).

Whatever... made me smile quite a bit ;).
