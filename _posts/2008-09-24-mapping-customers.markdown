I'm **really** into my Google Maps at the moment. With the amount I'm using
it, it's easily my favourite Google service, except maybe Gmail. Or Reader. Or
Analytics. Screw it, they're all brilliant.

The latest creation comes from a service called [map a
list](http://mapalist.com/), which Lifehacker [played
with](http://lifehacker.com/400382/map-a-list-puts-spreadsheet-addresses-on-google-maps)
a month ago. I couldn't think of a decent use for it myself, but someone
pointed out that it would be fantastic for mapping customers who have signed
up their details with a company. A massive advantage is that a business owner
can immediately see whether handing out leaflets or flyers has had the
intended effect. It works really nicely: link it to your Google account,
select a spreadsheet to pull data from, link columns in the spreadsheet to
address fields and... boom!

Here's the service containing a bit of post code data (and with hindsight, I
could have used it for my earlier post on [mapping
friends](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/09/the-people-i-know-map/)). Love it.
