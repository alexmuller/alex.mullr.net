A while back I posted about how [Jack Waterhouse was causing a stir on
Facebook](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2009/07/jack-waterhouse/). In case your
faith in the average person has been somewhat restored since then, I thought
I’d draw your attention to the latest group to spring up: “[fuck praying 4
Haiti some thing needs to control the
population](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&gid=246184118169)”.

This is troubling on at least three counts (that I can see):

1. Facebook doesn’t seem to have sufficient power to deal with stuff like this
    cropping up. They’ve plastered links to ‘report’ posts all over the place, but
    there’s no indication this actually does anything.
2. There’s still no accountability here, even with this being linked to
    people’s online identities; it’s too easy to play the “ahh, somebody else did
    this using my account” card.
3. People exist who are actually this stupid.

Eloquent.

If you’d like to help people less fortunate than you, Google’s put a link to
the [crisis response page](http://www.google.com/relief/haitiearthquake/) on
their homepage.
