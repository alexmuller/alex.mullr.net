[Via @kyleve](http://twitter.com/patio11/status/46976343191195648), a great
post on the Japanese earthquake:

> Far and away the worst thing that happened in the earthquake was that
> a lot of people drowned.  Your thoughts and prayers for them and their
> families are appreciated.  This is terrible, and we’ll learn ways to
> better avoid it in the future, but considering the magnitude of the
> disaster we got off relatively lightly.  (An earlier draft of this
> post said “lucky.” I have since reworded because, honestly, screw
> luck.  Luck had absolutely nothing to do with it.  Decades of good
> engineering, planning, and following the bloody checklist are why this
> was a serious disaster and not a nation-ending catastrophe like it
> would have been in many, many other places.)
