This is how foursquare displays the map for [CJ’s
Cafe](http://foursquare.com/venue/256599) in London. They got “The Vale” part
right, but it’s totally in the wrong part of the city. If you take the address
including the postcode and put it in Google Maps, you’ll see that [it’s
actually in
Acton](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=611846857883578591&q=CJ%2527s+Cafe,+W3+7SH&hl=en&cd=1&cad=src:pplink&ei=zw06S87xIcnisAbGg_D4CQ&sig2=H5XtDBs7bat7rSsCDPF2fQ).
This is a huge problem for their site, affecting many venues (in London at
least). And this makes checking in much more difficult, possibly leading to
duplicate venues, and bigger problems.

For some reason, foursquare only looks up the first line of the address to map
it. Not the business name, or the cross streets, or the postcode.

Guys, you have to fix this soon. For the time being,
[Gowalla](http://gowalla.com/users/alexmuller) wins.

(All these new location-based games and sites are fantastic, by the way. You
should check them all out and decide which you like best. Mashable wrote [a
nice comparison of these
two](http://mashable.com/2009/12/25/foursquare-gowalla/), if that’s your
thing.)
