Oh Facebook, just when I didn’t think you could get any better at encouraging
interaction on your site:

![Facebook: Whose face is this?](http://alexmuller.s3.amazonaws.com/static/blog/2010-07-24-facebook-whose-face.png)

Face recognition. Finding faces that aren’t already tagged. Presenting them,
ready-to-tag, to the owner. This is pure genius for getting people to
participate.
