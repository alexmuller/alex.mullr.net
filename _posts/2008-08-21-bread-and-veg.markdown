All credit for this goes to Rod√©ric (and I wish there was somewhere I could
link to him). I figured it might help to learn how to make a little food, just
two months before university starts...

No idea what this is called, and you'll have to trust me when I say it tastes
goooood. Oil in saucepan, cut up vegetables (we had onion, tomato and
mushroom) and "shove in" (technical terminology). Cook vegetables until, well,
"cooked" (again, very technical). Tear up little chunks of bread and throw in
saucepan. Leave a few minutes, and devour like you haven't eaten in a few
weeks.

This is cheap, easy, kinda healthy and hasn't killed me yet. Love.
