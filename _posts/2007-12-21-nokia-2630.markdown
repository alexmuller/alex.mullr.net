I love being able to post about Christmas presents safe in the knowledge that
the person concerned will never **ever** read this :-)

The **[Nokia 2630](http://www.nokia.co.uk/2630)** is an absolutely gorgeous
phone. Sure, it might not be as flashy or desirable as an iPhone, but we're
talking about a very different target market here. And damn, does this get the
job done, ticks all the boxes - yes, I know these specs won't appeal to most
of the (tech-savvy) people reading this, but I don't care; camera (albeit
VGA), Bluetooth 2.0, an FM radio, and it's incredibly thin. The UI is classic
Nokia, which makes it really easy to use, and the text is sufficiently large
that even the (kinda) ageing recipient will be able to read it easily.

The best part: just Â£50, including a tenner of Vodafone "Pay as you talk"
top-up. If I ever need a phone in a hurry, I'm going straight for one of
these.
