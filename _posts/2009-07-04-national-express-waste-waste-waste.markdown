Dear National Express,

Brill, you've [finally failed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8127851.stm). Now instead of
[money](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/status/2467178133)-[grabbing](http://londonist.com/2009/05/want_a_seat_pay_up.php)
like you're so used to, why don't you think about cost-cutting for once? For
example, I was having a think about those great tickets of yours…

This is what gets printed for me if I book a return journey from London Kings
Cross to York:

So, how about we rejig a few things. Even if you guys don't save any money
from printing, you'll get that fuzzy warm hippy feeling from using less card
or paper.

See, what I did there is applied a very complicated design process called
“make the stuff that people actually care about really big”. Unbelievably, it
doesn't matter to me what that long number is, so I made it small. Are you
catching my drift yet? “What's a ToD?”, I hear you cry. I have no idea. I also
don't care.

Using the first, we're down from five tickets per return journey to three. Now
let's suppose you make the collection receipt optional (I've been on your
service every couple of weeks since October last year, and I've never needed
one) and uncheck the box by default. Two tickets per return journey instead of
five.

The second's probably a little ambitious, but wow, imagine the possibilities
of a company actually removing stuff that isn't useful on 99% of journeys
(this statistic was very accurately calculated using a technique known as
“making it up”).

Yes, I'm sure there are reasons things haven't changed. National Rail probably
set up some beautiful unified system in 1994 that every train company can use
to print tickets, or whatever. Once again, I'm reminded of how big business
and IT (or the web) are a match made in heaven.
