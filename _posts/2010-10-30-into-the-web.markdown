Looking through my oldest Delicious bookmarks, I came across [this animated
GIF](http://mboffin.com/stuff/designline-openair.gif). I saved it to Delicious
in March 2007, but it came from Digg one day a few years ago, some time before
that. I remembered it perfectly straight away.

And I realised that this one megabyte animated image was what got me into the
web for good. I reckon we’d all look at this today and think “pffft, anybody
could whip up a WordPress theme to look like this in an hour”. And sure,
that’s true.

But even a few years ago, this was a big deal to me. That anybody could start
from something so basic and turn it into something that looked _decent_ in
such a short time was… stunning to me.

While the web can do [many more fancy
things](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html) today than it could when
that demo was created, it feels like it all still comes back to that.
