After writing about [spending time
online](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2009/12/spending-time-online/), something
obvious to everybody else quickly became obvious to me. I spend far too much
time on the computer. An unhealthy amount of time? Probably, actually. (Dear
me, I sound like my mum.)

So that’s what I’m going to do less of this year. And, because anything that
doesn’t include nice big numbers makes me feel queasy, I’m going to use a
computer to show me that I’m spending less time on the computer. I’m sure
there’s something wrong with that.

I’m not sure what I’ll do with all that free time. Might possibly… read a
book? That’s very last decade, I’m sure. If I manage to finish one this month,
it’ll be Chris Frith’s [Making Up the
Mind](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Up-Mind-Creates-Mental/dp/1405160225), as
recommended by [David](http://www.preoccupations.org/) far too long ago. Might
_even_ do some work. Crazy, I know.

I’ll let you know how things unfold, partly to keep me motivated. And I’ll see
you in the flesh sometime? It’d be a nice change to your Twitter profile
picture popping up now and then. Have a great year.
