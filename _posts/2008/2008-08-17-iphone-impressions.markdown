Hey everyone, say hello to Isabella (serious disclaimer: I'm not crazy for
giving my phone a name, promise...)

A couple of very, very quick thoughts:

* Battery life is horrible on this â€“ I guess I'm a heavy user, but I've found myself charging just running out of charge as I get home in the evening.
* GPS is the coolest thing ever.
* It's so much easier having phone and music in the same place. I always used to miss calls because I couldn't feel my K800i vibrating.
* The camera's not great. Meh, so what?
* I have conversations in SMS, **finally**.
* I still need to find a good IM application.
* Twitterific works well, as does TubeStatus, Facebook, Last.fm and Shazam. Tris is a great game. Remote is kinda cool.
* It's nice having a hardware switch for silent/ringer.

Now time to pack and run to the airport... data roaming is off.

Oh, and I obviously need to style `li` here... :(
