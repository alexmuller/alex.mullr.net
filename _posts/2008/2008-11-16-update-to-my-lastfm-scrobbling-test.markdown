I spent a bit of time this evening updating my Last.fm scrobbler (if you can
call it that), which I have [written
about](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/05/lastfms-audioscrobbler/) before.

It simply makes it a lot easier to use: enter your username and password,
click the button (I know the enter key doesn't work, and I hate myself for not
being able to fix it). You'll move to a page where you need to enter three
fields (artist, track and length) and click submit. Done. When compared to the
old method, it's several thousand times better.

I feel much happier. I'm trying to do something interesting with it involving
Delicious, but we'll see if I can get the code working or not...

**By the way:** not including [a giant, massive
link](http://alex.mullr.net/lastfm/v2scrobble.php) to the new page is one of
the smartest things I've ever done. *facepalm*.
