I quite like random little anecdotes/stories/tales, so thought I'd share:

There's an office here that the porters look after the keys for. If you want
to get in the office when there's nobody else around, you have to ask them for
a key; they check your university card against a list of people who are
authorised to borrow keys.

So here's the kicker: anyone can give in a new key list, even if you're not on
the old one. They don't check, they don't care. If this was a program, it
would be the most horribly flawed code.
