Friday night (the 1st of Feb) a massive group of us, about 10 in all, went
down to Brixton Academy to [see](http://www.last.fm/event/397246) Paramore
play with New Found Glory. We missed the first two supporting acts, Conditions
and Kids in Glass Houses, but got there for the start of NFG playing.

Honestly, I was a little disappointed by New Found Glory. Don't know quite
what I was expecting, or how it could have been better, but it wasn't what I
thought it would be. They were still good, just not the
"me-bouncing-off-the-walls" kinda good.

As for Paramore; if you don't know how I feel about them, imagine the happiest
thing you possibly can and multiply it by a couple of million. That's me when
I'm listening to them. It was awesome, so so awesome. I have no clue how to
review stuff, let alone a concert, so I'm not even going to bother trying. "I
loved it" will have to do :)

Mr Moosey (I have no clue how to refer to people here anymore) was fantastic
enough to share photos, so you should [take a
peek](http://www.flickr.com/photos/soberch/sets/72157603840641166/). And I've
got [no
clue](http://youtube.com/results?search_query=paramore+brixton&search_sort=video_view_count)
how you could watch videos of it to get a feel for the place, but maybe
YouTube has [a](http://youtube.com/watch?v=9YL0B6w-nMU)
