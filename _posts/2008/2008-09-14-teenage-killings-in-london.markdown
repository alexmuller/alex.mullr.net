Put this map together this afternoon, and it scares me quite a bit. It shows
the 25 teenage boys and one girl who have been killed inside the M25 since the
beginning of 2008 (I think I got them all).

The Google Map is embedded, so click through if you can't see it in an RSS
reader. It was **updated in 2009 with two, bringing it to a total of 28**
(using a [BBC News article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7510901.stm)), so
it's now complete.

What the hell is going on?
