Just in case you were wondering what Asynchronous Javascript and XML really
looks like in my mind:

<object classid="clsid:02bf25d5-8c17-4b23-bc80-d3488abddc6b" width="400" height="240" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab#version=6,0,2,0">
  <param name="src" value="http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-11-orangepaintad-poster.jpg" />
  <param name="href" value="http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-11-orangepaintad.mov" />
  <param name="target" value="myself" />
  <param name="controller" value="false" />
  <param name="autoplay" value="false" />
  <param name="scale" value="aspect" />
  <embed type="video/quicktime" width="400" height="240" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-11-orangepaintad-poster.jpg" scale="aspect" autoplay="false" controller="false" target="myself" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-11-orangepaintad.mov"></embed>
</object>

Wish there was an HD copy of that ad lying around somewhere, it's possibly my
favourite of all time. Low res [originally found
