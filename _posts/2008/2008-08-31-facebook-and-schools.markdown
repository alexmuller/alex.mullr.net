Somebody told me about her (nameless) school in West London that has simply
bizarre practices regarding pupils' safety online. The Catholic school, for
girls aged 11 to 16, has a Facebook account shared by the staff, and pupils
were encouraged to accept a friend request at a beginning of term assembly.
They were then told that if they did not accept this friend request, they
would be made to log in to their accounts in front of a member of staff so
that the adult could check for any privacy issues or "social problems."
They're searching for underage drinking, smoking or potentially revealing
photos, but don't seem to have quite grasped that Facebook is not the entire
Internet.

This is crazy. What's more crazy is that parents will support it, in the name
of _safety_.
