...but I still need to decide for sure what I'm going to go and watch. Here's
what I'm really looking forward to, and the choices I can't quite decide on
just yet.

### Day One, Thursday 9th October

Obviously I'll be <del>first</del> <ins>second</ins> (sorry, [she's](http://twitter.com/avalentine/)
ahead of me) in line to see Kevin Rose talk on The Future of News, but the
choices for the rest of the day are:

* Matt Webb talking on "What web design brings to products" or Blaine Cook (ex
  Twitter) and Joe Stump (digg) on how "Languages don't scale"
* "The future of enterprise web apps" by Kevin Marks of Google or something on Dopplr by Matt
  Biddulph

After lunch I'm looking forward to seeing Ron Richards from Revision3 talk on
how to bring Internet television to the masses. At 5:50 that afternoon Mike
Butcher of Techcrunch UK has an interview with three new startups which looks
to be fairly good.

### Day Two, Friday 10th October

Early morning we've got something from Sun Microsystems titled "The Fear
Factor: What to be Frightened of in Building A Web Application". After lunch
I've got a couple of tough ones to pick:

* Something called "Beyond Google Maps" or Jason Calacanis from Mahalo talking
  about startups
* Cloud computing from Jeff Barr of Amazon Web Services or Meebo on Scaling
  the Synchronous Web

After a couple more talks, there's a cosy little (ha, yeah right) chat with
Mark Zuckerburg. You might have heard of Mark, he makes some tiny social
networking site that nobody uses. And then... we have something a little bit
special.

### Diggnation!

Yep, those two jokers are back here again. I am looking forward to this so, so
much. Oh, and there's a party afterwards as well. Smile.

If you're going to be there, let me know - it would be nice to meet up with
some similarly inclined people. If you're not going to make it along, take a
look at the [timetable of
talks](http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/schedule) and give me your
opinion on what's hot.
