**This one's too long for a [tweet](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/), but
that's really all it is – don't go reading into it.**

I've been on and off about whether to password protect this post or not. For
the time being, here it is. If you think I've made a hideously bad judgement
call in posting it, please let me know.

This evening's been such a rollercoaster of emotions. I'm struck by two
completely different extremes; on the **one hand**, there are the people who
inspire confidence in me to continue acting the way I have been, and then I
hope I'm sort of making a difference; on the **other**, there are those who do
something stupid and insensitive and ruin it. Not only do they upset others
directly through their actions, they've effectively ruined that confidence.

**The worst part.** I have to do the work to try and undo all the crap they've
just created. Not for their benefit, to try and salvage friendship and trust,
and make sure that somebody's OK. They'll probably never read this, but that's
fine too.

I'm **lucky** in that I know so many people who are the former rather than the
latter. I just felt the need to write about how angry I am right now, I
apologise. For those who know me: the people who have pissed me off definitely
know that they've done it, and I guess you'll find out soon enough who they
are. I won't be talking to them again.

I'm actually stunned by the **lack of sensitivity** that two people have
managed to display this evening. I could ask whether it's a fault of the
impersonal nature of the social networking software they were using, or a
fault of the alcohol they were no doubt consuming, but it doesn't matter now.

Writing this has helped. I know I shouldn't have done it on the spur of the
moment, but I don't think I've jeopardised anything by doing so. It's too
general for that. Comments are apparently closed – that's probably the only
good call I've made in writing this. **Thanks.**
