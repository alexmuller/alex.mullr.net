**Consider this a [PSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement).**

If you're not backing up your computer, for the love of _*insert preferred
religious figure*_ do it now. Seriously, bookmark this or something, go do it,
and come on back. The Internet will still be exactly where you left it.

Jeez, c'mon - rumour (read: twitter) has it that
[adam2z](http://adam2z.com/blog/), a creative guy, isn't backing up his stuff.
What the hell is this? It makes me cringe knowing that a simple hard drive
failure would screw over so many hours of work.
[Buy](http://www.ebuyer.com/cat/Hard-Drives/subcat/External-Desktop-Drives) an
external hard drive, plug it in, and at the **very** least, drag your stuff
over to it. Move on to more complicated solutions like offsite or bootable if
you can be bothered, but do something. Cost can't be blamed anymore - if you
can afford a computer (the absolute cheapest of which is £300), you can afford
a £60 external hard drive.

What makes me really nervous is that there are seriously simple "consumer"
solutions like Apple's [Time
Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html), but even the
computer-savvy people I know aren't doing anything. How does the rest of the
world stand a chance?
