If you could follow along and tell me where I've gone wrong with this maths,
I'd appreciate it. I spoke to T-Mobile yesterday and the guy confirmed that on
my contract, I was being charged 79 pence per kilobyte of mobile data.

My iPhone says that in the last two weeks I've had it, I've received 56.1 MB
(which Google claims is equal to 57446.4 KB).

Multiply the number of kilobytes by 79, you get 4538265.6.

So I'm thinking that the "unlimited" included data I've used on my iPhone in
the last two weeks would have got me a bill for £45,382.66 from T-Mobile...
