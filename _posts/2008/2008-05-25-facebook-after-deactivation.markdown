This, I had to share... simply because it's the **best** explanation for
anything to do with Facebook, ever:

> You know \[he\] can actually still see this message despite temporarily
> deactivating his account. He memorised the source code for this
> particular website and there's no privacy for the coding from which
> the words can be obtained.
