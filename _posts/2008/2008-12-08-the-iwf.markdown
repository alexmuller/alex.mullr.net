Here's the deal, if you haven't heard this blow up in the last couple of days.
It first kicked off around midday on the 5th December when it was discovered
on Wikipedia that all users in the UK were being passed through a transparent
proxy; allowing content to be filtered, in this case the [Virgin
Killer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Killer) article and image.

The Internet Watch Foundation is deeming that this image should be blocked in
the UK because, after receiving a report from a member of the public, they
decided it was child pornography. Whether it is or isn't is up for debate
(though personally I think there's no way in hell it qualifies), but what
really pisses me off is that they don't even apply their own rules across the
board.

The following screenshot was taken from my O2 phone (because thankfully we're
not filtered here at uni):

On this same phone, the Wikipedia article mentioned is blocked - if you're
interested, I get an "HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden" error. I guess the only message
I have to share is that **censorship does nothing**.

There's a good conversation from BBC Radio 4's Today programme between David
Gerard (a Wikipedia contributor) and Susan Robertson of the IWF included
below, originally [here](http://www.bathrobecabal.org/bbcinterview.mp3).
There's [a massive
discussion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/2008_IWF_action)
on Wikipedia about it, and Ian Betteridge has [one of the better
articles](http://technovia.co.uk/2008/12/are-some-uk-isps-censoring-wikipedia.html).
