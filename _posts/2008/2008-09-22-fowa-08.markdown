I'm lucky to be going to the Future of Web Apps conference this October... and
unlike [last year](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2007/10/fowa/), I'm there on a
proper student ticket this time. That means I get to go see talks from the
likes of Digg, Google, Dopplr, Rev3, Twitter, Sun, Amazon, and Facebook (deep
breath), as well as some from people you might have heard of before...
Calacanis, Rose and Zuckerburg? I need to take a look through the schedule
properly and think about which I'm going to go and see.

In a simply fantastic move, Carsonified (the gorgeous people organising it)
just put 50 more student tickets up for grabs, so hopefully
[@avalentine](http://twitter.com/avalentine) can come along for a bit.
