The May 2008 beta version of Last.fm is live for paying subscribers, and I
have to say: I really do like it.

It's a lot cleaner than the current design, though some testers have called it
too much like other social networking sites - this is a valid concern, and
from the staff posts in the beta forum they are listening and constantly
adjusting the site.

The one issue of system development this has raised for me is that there are a
lot of people who have absolutely nothing useful to say at all:

This is **totally** useless in terms of figuring out what users want. Staff
have spent so many man hours working on this new design to improve the site,
and their asking for help is totally ruined by this comment. Somebody, teach
this guy to give useful feedback or hit him hard with the banhammer.

A quick screen capture:

I'm still thinking on my complete opinion of it, but subscribers can see the
current version live at [beta.last.fm](http://beta.last.fm/)

A couple of things I've mentioned/sent feedback on so far:

* The "On tour" red text after a band's name doesn't look great when it runs over onto a second line.
