During my first week at uni [I posted
about](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/10/to-the-cloud/) how I thought it was
really cool that York were considering moving email, calendar and
collaboration services to the cloud; EC3.

[Tim](http://hi.im/timsaunders) pointed out on my original post today that the
proposal was totally rejected, which is confirmed by the [university’s own
page](http://www.york.ac.uk/services/cserv/offdocs/projects.yrk/ec3/):

> The recommendation was that cloud computing services should not be taken up
as a means of delivering central email, calendaring or instant messaging
services for the University. The main factors contributing to this
recommendation were concerns around issues of data protection, privacy,
security and contractual arrangements.

They dumped it? The [March 2009 issue of
_Keynotes_](http://www.york.ac.uk/services/cserv/offdocs/keynotes/mar09.pdf)
(I’m a bit behind on this news, then) leads with:

> The Cloud Computing project which has seen extensive work both within and
without the Computing Service, and which has attracted much attention, has now
concluded. The Project Team, writing on page 6, give an overview of the
reasons to reject the use of cloud computing services at this time, **a
decision which, judging by the results of the extensive user consultation,
will attract both disappointment and relief from amongst our users**.

I’m disappointed. But not for me, for everybody else. The vast majority (80,
90%) of my friends use the university’s webmail service to get their email.
I’ve [posted about it](http://alex.mullr.net/blog/2008/09/email/) before, and
why it sucks. [Because it looks like
this](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-09-09-yorkmail.png).
It’s 2010, and we’re still dealing with webmail that looks like that? Webmail
that shows only fifty messages at a time and doesn’t group conversations? As
we know, most users leave the default checkboxes, don’t bother to configure
things and don’t dive into options. Sure, you can forward your email to a
different, personal, even Gmail account. Do most people? Of course not.

It’s a shame. When I first arrived at York, [that
flyer](http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexmuller/static/blog/2008-10-22-yorkcloud.jpg)
gave me hope that things might be different here. I’d grown up in a world
where my school used an ancient version of Internet Explorer and blocked
access to Google’s Gmail & Microsoft’s Hotmail. But it’s fine, because now I
can see this university is just like any, and every, other corporation. Ah
well.

### Addendum

[Tom](http://www.tomscott.com/), last year’s (2008–2009) YUSU President,
[comments via Twitter](http://twitter.com/tomscott/status/8687725886):

> I was part of that consultation last year. Their reasons are compelling -
data protection and research privacy being the big two

That’s good to hear, as I trust Tom’s opinion over that of an IT department
that I’ve never met.
