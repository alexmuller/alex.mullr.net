Cool little feature that I believe is unique to Break's video service - in
that I haven't seen it anywhere else yet.

Every video has a "play this next" ticker that scrolls through related videos
while the current one is playing. On hover, it displays a preview of the
related video and once clicked it changes to an "up next" (in a queuing kind
of way).

Innovation in stuff that's as normal (apply air quotes) as online video
streaming is getting more and more rare, so it's nice to see Break
implementing things that aren't just other sites' features rehashed.
