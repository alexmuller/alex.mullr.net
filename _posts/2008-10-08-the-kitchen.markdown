Today I finish three weeks of employment, the first proper work I've ever
done. It's been in a small restaurant startup in south west London, a place
called [The Kitchen](http://visitthekitchen.com/). Owned, managed and run by
Natalie Richmond and chef Thierry Laborde, the concept is something quite new
and different. Here comes my ad copy:

You order a couple of meals on their site, book a date and time and come along
to Parsons Green. Everything's all set up for you (we're talking ingredients,
utensils, instructions) and you prepare it with a couple of chefs on hand to
help. They package up the food for you, and you take it home to cook. Love the
idea. It's relatively cheap (£20 a week for evening meals?) and much faster
than doing the shopping yourself.

The software used on the site is something called
[EATS](http://www.eatsolution.com/), which in itself hasn't been bad. The UI
on the backend is more complicated than it needs to be, but this is a trend
that can be seen more and more with new content management systems. I hope
I'll find time to write something more on the design and branding work they've
had done there, as some gorgeous stuff has been created by a small company in
central London.

Bulleted thoughts:

* Networking a printer on a Windows network is harder than it looks.
  Especially when you have a BT BusinessHub to contend with - yuck.
* [Programming a cash
  register](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/statuses/942008841) is **so** much
  harder than programming a computer.
* Fax machines are still used?!
* Outlook is disgusting, and Access is actually scarily bearable.
* [Dell is fantastic](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/statuses/945145273). They
  delivered a machine five days before they said they would, and four days
  after I ordered it.

In any case: cheers, Natalie & Mark, Thierry & Claudio, Katie & Zuzana, Jhon &
Nico and Clare. And Sophia for getting me there in the first place. As well as
all the customers I've had to talk to over the last 20 days, of course - they
have been great too. It's done great things for my confidence, and I'm going
to miss it.
