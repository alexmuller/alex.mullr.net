Peter Rojas and Ryan Block make a good point on the gdgt podcast, one that made me stop and think:

>   * I think the tell will be a year from now, how many people at Google are running Chrome OS as their primary, or say sole, operating system at work. And I think that that number will actually be relatively low. I think that most people will still be running a more fully functioning install of Linux.
>   * I don’t think you could develop code in Chrome OS.
>   * There isn’t really a good, at least that I’ve heard of, a good web-based IDE, web-based code developing. You can’t substitute a terminal in the browser.

I’ve seen nothing so far that makes me want to get rid of TextMate (my text editor of choice on the Mac). But like I’ve said (somewhere, possibly on Twitter?) before, there’s _nothing_ to stop this from being a secondary machine.
