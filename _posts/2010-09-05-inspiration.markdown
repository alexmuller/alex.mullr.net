I’ve been going to Carsonified’s Future of Web Apps since 2007, but with the
prices this year (£699 anyone?) and missing out on all the student tickets,
[Michael](http://www.michaelhenley.co.uk/) and I moseyed on down to Brighton
for a day at dConstruct.

Like FOWA before it, dConstruct 2010 was my motivational and inspirational day
of the year; a day that reminds me why it’s even worth switching on the
computer in the morning. A whole day to get out the office (or grotty student
bedroom, depending on employment status), see a great place (Brighton is
really, really nice), talk to some people you don’t get to see all that often
and listen to some people you might never get to hear speak again.

I wish I’d taken grown-up notes, but these were my important parts:

* Marty Neumeier: be good and different. Very different.
* James Bridle: history is more important than we could ever realise. The man
  [printed out Wikipedia](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stml/sets/72157624693833091/).
* Merlin Mann: being a nerd is great, because you care. As long as you know
  which nerd to be next: don’t get replaced by a bash script.
