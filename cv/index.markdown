I'll have more to add here soon, but for now [there's a PDF copy of my CV](muller_cv.pdf) available.

## Previous work and experience ##

### Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's Award (2005) ###

I completed the award while at school, which included volunteering locally and
improving my knowledge of Microsoft Office through completion of the
advanced-level [European Computer Driving
License](http://www.bcs.org/category/14424). The expedition showed us how to
work together as a team, both in the planning and undertaking.

## Additional experience ##

- Wikipedia administrator since February 2008.
