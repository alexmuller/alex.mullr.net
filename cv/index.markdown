## Older work and experience ##

### One Click Orgs (2010 to 2011) ###

[One Click Orgs][oco] is an online service to help groups with their legal,
decision making and membership structure. I regularly worked over IRC and
in person with other volunteer developers, [committing][oco-commits]
Ruby on Rails, Haml and Sass code to the [OCO GitHub repository][oco-repo].

### York Students in Schools (January 2009 to February 2010) ###

I was involved with the [York Students in Schools][ysis] placement scheme, spending
half a day each week at a local school to assist the teacher with activities
and any computing issues or questions. I feel that the placement was useful in
many respects, primarily because it greatly improved my explanatory and
presentation skills.

### Web developer, Nouse (2008 to 2009) and Web designer, YSTV (2009 to 2011) ###

At university I became very involved with media societies, including the
student newspaper Nouse and the television station YSTV. Redeveloping the
newspaper's website was invaluable experience for working in a team,
reinforcing obvious good practices such as detailed code commenting. YSTV has
offered similar experiences, though there what I found most useful were the
weekly "station meetings", where I was able to give opinions and be
part of a group that makes decisions about the future of the station.

### Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's Award (2005) ###

I completed the award while at school, which included volunteering locally and
improving my knowledge of Microsoft Office through completion of the
advanced-level [European Computer Driving
License](http://www.bcs.org/category/14424). The expedition showed us how to
work together as a team, both in the planning and undertaking.
