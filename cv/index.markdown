## Older work and experience ##

### Web developer, Nouse (2008&mdash;2009) and Web designer, YSTV (2009&mdash;2011) ###

At university I became very involved with media societies, including the
student newspaper Nouse and the television station YSTV. Redeveloping the
newspaper's website was invaluable experience for working in a team,
reinforcing obvious good practices such as detailed code commenting. YSTV has
offered similar experiences, though there what I found most useful were the
weekly "station meetings", where I was able to give opinions and be
part of a group that makes decisions about the future of the station.

### Bronze Duke of Edinburgh's Award (2005) ###

I completed the award while at school, which included volunteering locally and
improving my knowledge of Microsoft Office through completion of the
advanced-level [European Computer Driving
License](http://www.bcs.org/category/14424). The expedition showed us how to
work together as a team, both in the planning and undertaking.
