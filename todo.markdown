## Jekyll ##

- In `blog/index.html`, include "a few random ones from the archive"
- Tags need to be lowercase URLs, e.g. York
- Get rid of Feedburner?

### Minor ###

- Shortlink/canonical for blog posts (mostly done in Apache)

### Done ###

- Google Analytics
- RSS -> Feedburner (requires a "plain" template)
- Sass instead of CSS
- In `archive_yearly.html`, generate the list of years automatically
