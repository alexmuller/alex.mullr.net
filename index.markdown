  Hi. I'm a final year student at the University of York,
  in the Computer Science and Maths departments.

## Hello! My name's Alex. ##

{% include gravatar.html %}

I’ve completed two years of undergraduate study (in Computer Science and
Maths) at the [University of York][york]. I worked at [GlaxoSmithKline][gsk],
a large pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare company, from July 2010 until
September 2011.

I've finished my final year of university, in which I learnt loads of
Python, a ton of probability & statistics and took a course titled
"Crypto, Attacks & Countermeasures". And I had
[an incredibly fun final-year project][csproj] to boot.

Life’s brill. I loved this year so much that I had to look up the source of a
quote that keeps coming to mind. Turns out it's apparently Confucius: "Choose
a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."

- I have a [blog][].
- I also have a [CV][].

My email address is <alex@mullr.net>.
