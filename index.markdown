  Hi. I'm a final year student at the University of York,
  in the Computer Science and Maths departments.

I’m a graduate of the [University of York][york] with a Bachelor's degree in
Computer Science and Maths. I worked at [GlaxoSmithKline][gsk], a large
pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare company, from July 2010 until September
2011. I finished my final year of university in July 2012, in which I learnt
loads of Python, a ton of probability & statistics and took a course titled
"Crypto, Attacks & Countermeasures". And I had [an incredibly fun final-year
project][csproj] to boot.

Life’s brill. I loved this year so much that I had to look up the source of a
quote that keeps coming to mind. Turns out it's apparently Confucius: "Choose
a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."

Right now I work in [Research and Development at News
International][newsintrd], where a normal day revolves around creating
prototypes of web applications in Ruby on Rails.

<!--

  Not many days are normal, though. There's that time we made a piñata.

- I have a [blog][].
- I also have a [CV][].
