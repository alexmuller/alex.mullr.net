I’m a graduate of the University of York with a Bachelor's degree in Computer
Science and Maths. I worked at GlaxoSmithKline, a large pharmaceutical and
consumer healthcare company, from July 2010 until September 2011. I finished
my final year of university in July 2012, in which I learnt loads of Python, a
ton of probability & statistics and took a course titled "Crypto, Attacks &
Countermeasures". And I had [an incredibly fun final-year project][csproj] to
boot.

Life’s brill. I loved my final year of university so much that I had to look
up the source of a quote that keeps coming to mind. Turns out it's apparently
Confucius:

> "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in
> your life."

I've worked in Research and Development at News International, where a normal
day revolved around creating prototypes of web applications in Ruby on Rails.

<!-- Not many days were normal, though.
     There's that time we made an internet-controlled piñata. -->

Right now I work as a software developer on the GOV.UK Infrastructure team, as
part of the [Government Digital Service][gds]. I used to work on the [Performance Platform][performanceplatform].
There's a lot of Python, Ruby and MongoDB and a little bit of lots of other things.
I've already learnt a ridiculous amount about configuring servers (using Puppet).

- I have a [blog][].
- I also have a [CV][].
