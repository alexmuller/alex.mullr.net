This is really just the folder that the CSS is kept in, but I suppose that'd
be an appropriate place for this document.

## Colours ##

I wish I could tell you there was a great reason for these colours. There
isn't. Picked them out of thin air in about 2007 and have stuck with them ever
since.

<style type="text/css">
  ul#colours li {
    border: 2px solid #000;
    color: #000;
    float: left;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 6px;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    text-shadow: 0 0 4px #fff;
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<ul id="colours">
  <li style="background-color: #d0dae9">Light blue</li>
  <li style="background-color: #20406f">Dark blue</li>
  <li style="background-color: #A50827">Red</li>
</ul>
